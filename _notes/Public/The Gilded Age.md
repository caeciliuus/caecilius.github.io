# The Gilded Age
#### Key factors in the industrial revolution
- **Technology & innovation**: electric power, power generator, internal combustion
- **Mechanization, structure of work, economies of scale**: dis-assembly lines (meat packing led the day) → assembly lines via Henry Ford
- **Business structures/corporate organization**
	- ==Pool:== gentlemen's agreement in which business owners agree not to raise prices. Illegal now
	- ==Trusts:== business owned by one person, but is broken up into stock & given to a board of trustees
	- ==Cartel:== association of business owners who work together to coordinate prices/production
	- ==Incorporation:== a company recognized by law to exist independently from its owners, with the ability to own property, borrow money, sue or be sued. Encourages funding new business organization
- **Consumer republic:** a new national culture
#### Democratization of convenience
- Edison - tungsten filament/incandescent light bulb. AC/DC and power generators, also phonograph and motion pictures
	- Didn't invent lightbulbs but was the first person to make it affordable  
- Henry Ford - democratized the automobile → moving assembly line $5/day ^e2d946
- Andrew Carnegie - Bessemer process and steel production
- DuPonts - gunpowder monopoly → diversified into fertilizer, dyes, cellulose, other chemical products
- Duke, Kellogg, Post
#### New corporate organization
- New technologies required large capital investments, investment banking entered a new age
- Holding companies are companies that get bought out, but the goods are still produced under the original company's name → example: Pepsi owning multiple different drink brands
- ==Horizontal integration:== owning all of one SPECIFIC part of production
- ==Vertical integration:== companies own every step in production. Ex: Ford owning coal mines, transportation from coal → plant, etc
#### Dissent? To capitalism?
- ==Social Darwinism== - Herbert Spencer: the people that have wealth b/c they're better ⇒ trusts shouldn't be destroyed. Wealth flows to those most capable of handling it   ^3aef5f
	- Edward Bellamy rejects this notion in *Looking Backward*, stating the **government owns the means of production**. Sets up an alternate economic world where capitalism is restrained. Everyone works according to their abilities
- ==Sherman Antitrust Act== (1890): Prohibits "every contract, combination, or conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states." Makes it illegal for individuals or companies to "monopolize"  ^1a2e5c
- ==*U.S v. E.C Knight Co*== (1895): sugar trust owned 98% of sugar-refining but court ruled that control of manufacturing doesn't equal control of trade ⇒ discarded much of the Sherman Antitrust Act
#### Changing nature and status of labor
- ==Scientific Management/Fredrick Taylor== ("Taylorism"): scientific organization of production by subdividing tasks to increase efficiency ⇒ make jobs increasingly skill-less
- Workers increasingly powerless, become the interchangeable parts themselves
	- Ex: McCormick Reapers - had been hand made by skilled machinists and woodworkers. Introduced mechanization and machine patterns to allow precise duplication of interchangeable parts.  <font style="color:green">1880: 21,000 reapers</font> → <font style="color:blue">1885: 100,000 reapers</font>
- ==Pink collar jobs==
	- Woman and children drive down labor costs ⇒ child labor laws very ineffective
	- "Women's work": clerical/secretarial and sales (typists, filing clerks, billing clerks, store clerks), "Hello Girls" (telephone operators), manufacturing (factory job) and domestic service → [[Civil War & Reconstruction#^ac837e|Government girls]]
#### Freedom of contract & the S.C
- ==Freedom of Contract:== **labor is property, I have a property right to my labor**, I can sell it without the oversight of the state (w/in the law). Market conditions of supply and demand fix wages at a living rate, beyond that, I have the right to alienate my property any way I see fit ⇒ **PROBLEM**: causes oversupply of workers!! Freedom of contract is used to strike down laws like minimum wage, max working hours,… The market will regulate itself
	- Henry Ford argues against this and creates the [[#^e2d946|$5 day]]: if your labor force can't purchase the good you're producing, you're losing. ALTERNATE: can decrease required workforce
- ==*Holden v. Hardy*== (1891): state creates a law stating minors can't work in a mine for > 10 hours in a day to cut accident rate down. Supreme court agrees w/ the state this time **ONLY B/C** of the danger associated w/ mining
- ==*Lochner v. New York*== (1905): S.C rules that NY can't create a law that limits the max # of working hours for bakers (it isn't dangerous enough). Industry:
- ==*Muller v. Oregon*== (1908): S.C upholds a law limiting the workday for women to 10 hours. One of the first cases in which the S.C recognized the importance of protecting the rights of workers. Industry: laundry
	- ==Brandeis Brief:== argument that women need to be protected so they can produce offspring

#### "New Immigrants"
- Older patterns of immigration supplanted after 1880
##### Push factors
- Social unrest b/c Tsars are losing power → creating power vacuum
- Russia finally ends feudalism
- Italy in transition (?) phase
- Russia's pogroms
- Germany trying to unify ->waves of political unrest causing Germans to leave
##### Pull factors
- Relative religious freedom
- Industrialization
- [[Civil War & Reconstruction#^0b9b31|Homestead Act]] (esp. attract Germans b/c its similar to farming back home)
- ==Serial immigration== - immigrants move via word of mouth
- Italians overwhelmingly work for a few years to make money, then return home
##### Challenges
- Catholic/Jewism/Eastern Orthodox
- Unfamiliar languages
- Low-skill occupations
- Not used to democracy
![[Pasted image 20230209114933.png|500]]
- ==Ethnic enclaves/urban borderlands (ghettos)==: areas in which one specific ethnic group has settled → greater cultural retention, less assimilation
- Continued racism w/ the [[The West#^600dcd|Chinese Exclusion Act]] & ==Geary Act:== → forced Chinese Americans to carry a piece of paper to confirm their citizenship ^74a875
##### New problems / new solutions
- American urban centers develop differently than Europe - property on edge of city is most expensive in USA **V.S** property right in the middle of the city is the most expensive in Europe
- Technology saves the day → furnaces, electric lighting, indoor plumbing
- [Jacob Riis - *How the Other Half Lives*:](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fmymodernmet.com%2Fjacob-riis-how-the-other-half-lives%2F&psig=AOvVaw1A682NifKXC4GEWwMTEFk0&ust=1676048631707000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CA8QjRxqFwoTCIi3_Oz1iP0CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAX) exposed the difficult life of a first-generation immigrants & wealth inequality
- ==Political Machines:== organizations used to influence and control the political process via fraud. Found in large cities, farmed votes by helping immigrants with finding jobs,.. Even though they succeeded via illegal means, they are well-supported b/c they support the immigrants when no one else will
- ==City Beautiful Movement:== group of women that try and fix up cities to make them pretty
- ==Settlement House Movement:==  Group of women who tour Europe after school and create an organized effort to provide social services, education, and other assistance to the urban poor.
	- Supported struggling immigrants, women by holding cooking classes, daycare centers, etc. [Jane Addams on Child Labor](https://study.com/academy/lesson/florence-kelley-jane-addams-on-child-labor.html#:~:text=Jane)
	- Addams and Florence Kelley were women from similar backgrounds, means of accomplishing these goals. ^0fe5b4
##### Gilded Age politics
- ==Gilded age:== term coined by Mark Twain, the U.S as a nation is shiny is golden and shiny on the outside, but there is a corrupt core of decadence and even decay
- Massie voter turnout: 80% of electorate participated in elections (1870 - 1896)
- Major issues of the day: railroad regulation, Civil War pensions for Northern veterans, patronage/spoils system, tariffs and currency (gold vs. silver standard)
- Major disagreements on how best to deal w/ these issues
##### [[S1 Wiki(APUSH.)#^49bf0a|Democrats v. Whigs]]
- [[S1 Wiki(APUSH.)#^c03e4a|Republicans]]: wide spectrum in the Republican party. Divisions among the Stalwarts & Half Breeds, both working the spoils system for their own benefit. Also the Mugwumps (Republicans who wanted more reform of things like civil service). The Republican faction is a **coalition** rather than a party
	- Regional differences: Northern Republicans want the gold standard, western Republicans want silver standard
	- In general, they believed the govt. should be an agency of reform
- [[S1 Wiki(APUSH.)#^776a9f|Democrats]]: Northern interested in urban and economic issues, still have support of immigrants. Southern Democrats looks to defend white supremacy (still). In general, believe that governments shouldn't interfere in issues of personal liberty
	- Against regressive taxes (support income tax) → a tax that takes a larger percentage of income from low-income groups than from high-income groups **V.** supportive of progressive taxes → taxes that fuck with the rich more than the poor
	- Against tariffs all together
	- Silver standard

##### Police powers & opposition
- ==Policing powers:== State police powers have nothing to do w/ state police! A state has the legislative power to protect the general welfare of the population through regulation and enforcement of order. Nanny state? → building codes, quarantine laws, pure food and drug acts, control of patent medicines,..
- State laws can enforce laws on business owners to help the workers
- BUT, under the 14th amendment, businesses have the right to use their private property as they see fit. Business regulation cannot deny business profit w/o due process - according to the S.C :(
##### Railroads/pensions/civil service/tariffs/money supply
- Railroad regulation? ==*Munn v. Illinois*:== yes, grain warehouses operate in the public interest and can be regulated; ==Wabash Cases:== railroad operations between several states is interstate & cannot be regulated by a single state → Interstate Commerce Commission; ==Maximum Freight Rate Case:== limits based on the 14th amendment rights of railroads →  govt. cannot set rate  ^dbdd35
- Pensions: no one wants to vote against pensions… but they are a huge govt. expenditure (40% of federal annual budget by 1900)
- ==Civil Service Reform:== despite advantage to political parties and machines, after President Garfield's assassination, there's huge support for the ==Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act== → provided that federal government jobs be awarded on the basis of merit and that government employees be selected through competitive exams, made it unlawful to fire or demote for political reasons employees who were covered by the law
#### African Americans & women
- Discrimination and segregation: national issue, by either state/local law (==Jim Crow laws==) or by customary practice
	- Housing, unemployment, access to facilities such as parks, hotels, and department stores/theatres
	- S.C says states must regulate individual behavior on discrimination, but federal government can force the states to pass anti-discrimination
- Ongoing violence against African Americans - lynching
	- Ida B. Wells - ==*The Red Record (Free Speech and Headlight)*==: list of all the lynchings across the country, used southern news sources to prove her point
- Disfranchisement
	- Poll taxes: a tax of a fixed amount per person and payable as a requirement for the right to vote
	- *U.S v. Reese* (1876): S.C ruled on legality of the poll tax as legal → "federal govt. is only responsible for supporting the 14th amendment to the letter of the law: 'if you're denied via race'
	- ==Mississippi Plan== (poll tax, literacy test): in order to vote, the state required that citizens pay all their taxes first, be literate, and have been residents of the state for two years and one year in an electoral district
	- ==Grandfather clause==: "if you grandfather couldn't vote in 1868, you can't vote"
- ==*Plessy v. Ferguson*==: S.C rules things can be separated as long as there's equal facilities for blacks ; "one drop blood rule"
	- Plessy set up the court case when he was on a train (crossed state lines), and was $\frac{1}{8}$ black
- ==*Cumming v. Country Board*==: S.C ruled that a county board of education had the authority to exclude African-American children from its schools
#### Women's suffrage
- Frances Willard - head of WCTU: pivoted from suffrage → prohibition
- ==Maternalist argument==: women are able to participate in civil activities if they can justify it with the fact that it's for their children → [[March MCQ WIKI#^fe3a2e|can fulfill their roles of guardian of the home best if they vote]]  ^dd299f
- ==National Women Suffrage Society== (Susan B. Anthony) splits @ end of Civil War over the 15th Amendment → some believe that blacks should have voting rights before women
	- Radical leaders
	- Opposed the 15th amendment
	- Enfranchisement through a federal constitutional amendment
- ==American Women Suffrage Association==: new organization only looking @ the issue of suffrage **on the state level**. Led by Lucy stone, created idea of "stoners" → women who keep their own name.
	- Pro 15th amendment
- **NWSS and AWSA used to  be one organization but there was a schism during reconstruction b/c members were split over the 15th amendment. Approached suffrage movement w/ different goals
- ==National and American Women Suffrage Association==: eventually the two organizations merged into one
#### Populism
- ==Granges== (local, west): organizations of farmers to discuss agricultural styles, in an attempt to correct widespread costly and inefficient methods. Mostly a social movement but talks of unionizing arise  
	- ==Grange laws==: laws promoted by Granges regulating the fees grain elevator companies and railroads charged farmers (ex: [[#^dbdd35|Munn v. Illinois]])
##### Farmer's Alliances (regional, south and west)
- Divided regionally - Great Plains and the South (West has a smaller alliance movement)
- Farmer cooperatives: pooling resources to exert more economic pressure. Unified group to sell crops and livestock, buy supplies and manufactured goods
- **==Subtreasury Plan==**
	1. Federal govt. builds warehouses to store nonperishable crops while market stabilizes. In the interim, government guarantees loans up to 80% of the market value of their crops
	2. Government guaranteed low interest loans to farmers to buy land
- Unable to unify due to racial and sectional differences: problem of Jim Crow and sharecropping in the South supporting white supremacy but dividing white/AA farmers (north & south are divided over tariffs)
%%parmesan ranch chips%% ^af1be7
#### Populists and the Omaha Platform: "Raise less corn and more hell"
- Elect a populist candidate and they will support the following issues
	1. Strong, engaged and modern governments
	2. Nationalized country's railroads and telegraph lines (not well received)
	3. Reclaim land owned for speculative purposes by railroads and foreigners
	4. Create postal savings banks that will operate in the people's interests
	5. Utilize the [[#^af1be7|Subtreasury Plan]]
	6. Silver > gold [[March MCQ WIKI#^77af92|silver v. gold]]
	7. Direct election of senators ( → 17th amendment)
	8. Secret ballot for voting
	9. Graduate income tax ( → 16th amendment), [[March MCQ WIKI#^561c6f|regressive taxes]]
	10. Shorter workday, try to link w/ different
#### Panic of 1893
- Failure of Philadelphia & Reading Railroad causes a chain reaction → puts itself too far extended on credit and chains die.
- Expanding supply, can market go up?
- ==$100 million level== - gold reserves: everyone tries to get their money in gold, but the govt. creates act changing the exchange rate of gold:silver =  16:1 → ==Sherman *something* act
- JP Morgan bails out the U.S govt. by giving them a lot of gold → is repaid w/ federal bonds
- Cleveland gets cancer →  tells the nation that he's going sailing → receives surgery ON THE BOAT! so that his VP doesn't switch
- As a result of the panic, voting rate drops significantly → down to 30% in the south
	- Less of a focus on party loyalty
	- More political options
#### Pervasive problems for the populists
##### Fusion ticket
- 1896 - Populists supported Democratic Candidate William Jennings Bryan for president on the silver standard
- William McKinley & the gold standard win
