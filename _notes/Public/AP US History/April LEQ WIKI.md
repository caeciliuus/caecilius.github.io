# April LEQ WIKI
### Gilded Age (1877 - 1920)
#### Gilded Age Politics
- ==Gilded age:== term coined by Mark Twain, the U.S as a nation is shiny is golden and shiny on the outside, but there is a corrupt core of decadence and even decay
- Massie voter turnout: 80% of electorate participated in elections (1870 - 1896)
- Major issues of the day: railroad regulation, Civil War pensions for Northern veterans, patronage/spoils system, tariffs and currency (gold vs. silver standard) ^148136
- Major disagreements on how best to deal w/ these issues
#### [[S1 Wiki(APUSH.)#^49bf0a|Democrats v. Whigs]]
- [[S1 Wiki(APUSH.)#^c03e4a|Republicans]]: wide spectrum in the Republican party. Divisions among the Stalwarts & Half Breeds, both working the spoils system for their own benefit. Also the Mugwumps (Republicans who wanted more reform of things like civil service). The Republican faction is a **coalition** rather than a party  ^9f7726
	- Regional differences: Northern Republicans want the gold standard, western Republicans want silver standard
	- In general, they believed the govt. should be an agency of reform
- [[S1 Wiki(APUSH.)#^f6cdb9|Democrats]]: Northern interested in urban and economic issues, still have support of immigrants. Southern Democrats looks to defend white supremacy (still). In general, believe that governments shouldn't interfere in issues of personal liberty ^dc97ec
	- Against regressive taxes (support income tax) → a tax that takes a larger percentage of income from low-income groups than from high-income groups **V.** supportive of progressive taxes → taxes that fuck with the rich more than the poor  ^561c6f
	- Against tariffs all together
	- Silver standard
		 ![[Party systems.canvas]]
#### Police powers & opposition
- ==Policing powers:== State police powers have nothing to do w/ state police! A state has the legislative power to protect the general welfare of the population through regulation and enforcement of order. Nanny state? → building codes, quarantine laws, pure food and drug acts, control of patent medicines,.. ^99c603
- State laws can enforce laws on business owners to help the workers
- BUT, under the 14th amendment, businesses have the right to use their private property as they see fit. Business regulation cannot deny business profit w/o due process - according to the S.C :(
#### Railroads/pensions/civil service/tariffs/money supply
- Railroad regulation?
	- *Munn v. Illinois*: yes, grain warehouses operate in the public interest and can be regulated
	- ==Wabash Cases:== railroad operations between several states is interstate & cannot be regulated by a single state → Interstate Commerce Act (Commission)
	- ==Maximum Freight Rate Case==: limits based on the 14th amendment rights of railroads →  govt. cannot set rate. "The invisible hand of the market will figure it out" ^d3d8e6
- Pensions: no one wants to vote against pensions… but they are a huge govt. expenditure (40% of federal annual budget by 1900)
- ==Civil Service Reform==: despite advantage to political parties and machines, after President Garfield's assassination, there's huge support for the ==Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act== → provided that federal government jobs be awarded on the basis of merit and that government employees be selected through competitive exams, made it unlawful to fire or demote for political reasons employees who were covered by the law. **Move away from the spoils system**
#### Tariffs/Gold v. Silver Monetary Policy
- Republican view (especially in the north): high tariffs are good → ex: McKinley tariff, Wilson-Gorman tariff, Dingley Tariff. But, government produces a surplus = bad. Republicans want the Democrats to reduce tariffs b/c **the government is not a 'for profit' institution**
- Silver v. gold: more money in economy, should be good for farmers and working class, allow farmers to secure bank loans → lets go for silver. This would create inflation, but they want it b/c they want their crop price to go up (debt is @ fixed interest rate). Businessmen: rest of the world is on the gold standard, we should be too b/c it'd make trade easier. SILVER PUTS MORE $ $ $ IN THE ECONOMY ^77af92
- ==Bimetallism:== idea of using gold AND silver
#### African Americans & women
- Discrimination and segregation: national issue, by either state/local law (==Jim Crow laws==) or by customary practice
	- Housing, unemployment, access to facilities such as parks, hotels, and department stores/theatres
	- S.C says states must regulate individual behavior on discrimination, but federal government can force the states to pass anti-discrimination
- Ongoing violence against African Americans - lynching
	- Ida B. Wells - *The Red Record (Free Speech and Headlight)*: list of all the lynchings across the country, used southern news sources to prove her point  ^1089dd
- Disfranchisement
	- Poll taxes: a tax of a fixed amount per person and payable as a requirement for the right to vote
	- *U.S v. Reese* (1876): S.C ruled on legality of the poll tax as legal → "federal govt. is only responsible for supporting the 14th amendment to the letter of the law: 'if you're denied via race'
	- ==Mississippi Plan== (poll tax, literacy test): in order to vote, the state required that citizens pay all their taxes first, be literate, and have been residents of the state for two years and one year in an electoral district
	- ==Grandfather clause==: "if you grandfather couldn't vote in 1868, you can't vote"
- *Plessy v. Ferguson*: S.C rules things can be separated as long as there's equal facilities for blacks ; "one drop blood rule"
	- Plessy set up the court case when he was on a train (crossed state lines), and was $\frac{1}{8}$ black
- *Cumming v. Country Board*: S.C ruled that a county board of education had the authority to exclude African-American children from its schools  
#### Women's suffrage
^a178dc
- Frances Willard - head of WCTU: pivoted from suffrage → prohibition
- ==Maternalist argument==: women are able to participate in civil activities if they can justify it with the fact that it's for their children → [[March MCQ WIKI#^fe3a2e|can fulfill their roles of guardian of the home best if they vote]]  ^dd299f
- ==National Women Suffrage Society== (Susan B. Anthony) splits @ end of Civil War over the 15th Amendment → some believe that blacks should have voting rights before women
	- Radical leaders
	- Opposed the 15th amendment
	- Enfranchisement through a federal constitutional amendment
- ==American Women Suffrage Association==: new organization only looking @ the issue of suffrage **on the state level**. Led by Lucy stone, created idea of "stoners" → women who keep their own name.
	- Pro 15th amendment
- **NWSS and AWSA used to  be one organization but there was a schism during reconstruction b/c members were split over the 15th amendment. Approached suffrage movement w/ different goals
- ==National and American Women Suffrage Association==: eventually the two organizations merged into one
#### Populism
- ==Granges== (local, west): organizations of farmers to discuss agricultural styles, in an attempt to correct widespread costly and inefficient methods. Mostly a social movement but talks of unionizing arise   ^27f5df
	- ==Grange laws==: laws promoted by Granges regulating the fees grain elevator companies and railroads charged farmers (ex: [[#^dbdd35|Munn v. Illinois]])
- **Farmer's Alliances (regional, south and west)**
	- Divided regionally - Great Plains and the South (West has a smaller alliance movement)
	- Farmer cooperatives: pooling resources to exert more economic pressure. Unified group to sell crops and livestock, buy supplies and manufactured goods
	- **==Subtreasury Plan==**
		1. Federal govt. builds warehouses to store nonperishable crops while market stabilizes. In the interim, government guarantees loans up to 80% of the market value of their crops
		2. Government guaranteed low interest loans to farmers [[to buy]] land
	- Unable to unify due to racial and sectional differences: problem of Jim Crow and sharecropping in the South supporting white supremacy but dividing white/AA farmers (north & south are divided over tariffs)
%%parmesan ranch chips%% ^af1be7
#### Populists and the Omaha Platform: "Raise less corn and more hell"
- Elect a populist candidate and they will support the following issues ^daac61
	1. Strong, engaged and modern governments
	2. Nationalized country's railroads and telegraph lines (not well received)
	3. Reclaim land owned for speculative purposes by railroads and foreigners
	4. Create postal savings banks that will operate in the people's interests
	5. Utilize the [[#^af1be7|Subtreasury Plan]]
	6. Silver > gold [[March MCQ WIKI#^77af92|silver v. gold]]
	7. Direct election of senators ( → 17th amendment)
	8. Secret ballot for voting
	9. Graduate income tax ( → 16th amendment), [[March MCQ WIKI#^561c6f|regressive taxes]]
	10. Shorter workday, try to link w/ different
#### Panic of 1893
- Failure of Philadelphia & Reading Railroad causes a chain reaction → puts itself too far extended on credit and chains die.
- Expanding supply, can market go up?
- ==$100 million level== - gold reserves: everyone tries to get their money in gold, but the govt. creates act changing the exchange rate of gold:silver =  16:1 → ==Sherman *something* act
- JP Morgan bails out the U.S govt. by giving them a lot of gold → is repaid w/ federal bonds
- Cleveland gets cancer →  tells the nation that he's going sailing → receives surgery ON THE BOAT! so that his VP doesn't switch
- As a result of the panic, voting rate drops significantly → down to 30% in the south
	- Less of a focus on party loyalty
	- More political options
### The [[Progressive Era]] (1895 - 1920)
#### What is progressivism?
- Reaction to the excesses of [[The Gilded Age]]
- "The era between 1895 and 1920 [which] included a series of movements, each aiming in one way or another to renovate or restore American society, values, and institutions with a hope that a better future lay ahead" → rejection of the "dog eat dog" attitude of [[The Gilded Age]]
#### Problems
- Industrial capitalism has led to overproduction, domineering monopolies, labor strife, and destruction of natural resources
- Cities breed poverty, crime, and disease
- Social order reconfigured with waves of immigrants AND creation of new managerial and professional classes
#### Solutions
- End abuse of power
- Protect the welfare of all people
- Reform institutions and promote social efficiency
#### Changing electorate
- 1896 election is pinnacle of popular participation
- Drop in the north from 80% → 60%, drop below 30% in the South
- @ the same time, there's a rise in national associations with political influence: ABA, NAWSA, NCL… etc
- New tools to help w/ democratic reform: (1) ==initiate== → propose new laws; (2) ==referendum== → voters can accept/reject a law; (3) ==recall== → remove elected officials from office
#### Muckrakers & middle class reform
- ==Muckraker:== term coined by T.R used as an insult to journalists identified with pre-WWI reform and exposé literature
	- Sought to reveal and reform the evils of the day. Wrote in magazines, newspapers, books, etc.
- [[The Gilded Age#^0fe5b4|Settlement House Movement]]
#### Social Gospel
- "The ==social gospel seeks== to bring men under repentance for their **collective** sins and to create a more sensitive and more modern conscience. It calls on us for the faith of the old prophet who believed in the **salvation of nations**"
- While Charles Sheldon asked "WWJD?", others like Walter Rauschenbusch wanted to create a kingdom of God on earth
#### Working class reform
- Especially effective in NYC thanks to the Triangle Shirtwaist factory fire
- ==Bread and butter reform:== safe factories/factory inspection, shorter workdays, worker compensation, protection of women & children laborers, better housing, better taxation ^630e49
- Progressives seek minimum age for employment, but ==common education laws== were more effective → spread of access to educational services
#### Socialism
- The struggle between the ==bourgeoise==, the middle-class who owns the means of production, and the proletariats, who labor for the wealth accumulation of others (bourgeoise)
- To fix this, the means of production, and the government (or workers collective) can ensure that all men and women receive fair pay for a fair day's work
- Not as problematic in [[The Gilded Age]], there was no tension that was caused by the Cold War
- ==Eugene Debs:== head of the American Railway Union who was imprisoned for his role in the [[March MCQ WIKI#^a0a675|Pullman Strike]], and after reading Karl Marx in jail, and ran for president as the socialist candidate 5 times (never won)
- Most Americans see socialism as incompatible with capitalism → "American Dream"

|<u>Northern Securities Company</u>: huge railway company that was Roosevelt's first broken trust. Was sympathetic to cooperation between govt. & business as he urged the Bureau of Corporations to aid companies in merging & expanding. Administration cajoled businesses to self-regulate, and they often cooperated b/c it helped them operate more efficiently & reduce overproduction |<u>Payne-Aldrich Tariff</u>: Payne bill was originally passed in the house to lower tariffs (very very high), but Senator Aldrich (fighting Bob) restored most of the cuts made by the tariff. Taft ended up passing the tariff, causing a schism in the Republican party: progressives & conservatives. |<u>New Freedom</u>: counter to Roosevelt's "New Nationalism" that revolved around the idea that concentrated economic power threatened individual liberty & that monopolies could be broken up so that the marketplace could be genuinely open. Didn't restore laissez-faire, however.                                                                                                   |
|<u>Hepburn Act</u>: strengthened the [[The Gilded Age#^dbdd35\|Interstate Commerce Commission]] to inspect railroad financials and set "just and reasonable rates". Also required shippers to prove they weren't violating the law                                                                                                                                                           |<u>Mann-Elkins Act</u>: bolstered the regulatory powers of the I.C.C and supported labor reforms such as shorter work hours & mine safety legislation.                                                                                                                                                   |<u>Clayton Anti Trust Act</u>: corrected deficiencies of the [[The Gilded Age#^1a2e5c\|Sherman Anti Trust Act]] by outlawing practices like price discrimination (lowering prices in some regions, but not others) and interlocking directorates (management of 2+ competing companies by the same executives). Also aided labor by exempting unions from its anti-combination provision |
|<u>Meat Inspection/Pure Food and Drug Act</u>: prohibited dangerously altered food and required that labels list all the ingredients of a product. Govt. had to finance inspections; meatpackers could appeal a decision                                                                                                                                                                     | ==16th Amendment==: legalized the federal income tax as a permanent source of federal income                                                                                                                                                                                                      |<u>Federal Trade Commission</u>: investigated companies and could issue cease & desists for unfair legal practices. Accused companies could appeal a decision in court                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|<u>Square Deal/Anthracite Coal Strike</u>: mine owners refuse to arbitrate strikers' demands of 8hr work day and higher pay, so Roosevelt threatened military action (for the first time against owners), forcing the owners to give in; didn't require recognition of union → cooperation                                                                                                   | ==17th Amendment==: provided for the direct election of senators                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | ==Federal Reserve Act==: established the nation's first national banking system since 1836. Created 12 district banks that lent $ to member banks @ low interest rates. By adjusting this rate, inflation could be controlled                                                                                                                                                     |
|<u>Conservationism</u>: Roosevelt first protected natl. wonders like the Olympic Peninsula & Grand Canyon, then expanded conservation w/ the creation of 5 natl. parks + 53 bird conservatories                                                                                                                                                                                              |<u>Taft broke 2x as many trusts in half the time as TR</u> but lacked the ability to rouse the public w/ spirited rhetoric.

#### Government and legislative reform
- **Weakening the political machines**
	- City managers (hired as experts rather than elected positions), who work as urban planners, and commissioners  
	- ==17th Amendment:== allowed for the direct election of senators
- **Prohibition**
	- ==Women's Christian Temperance Union== (WCTU): religious organization whose primary purpose was to combat the influence of alcohol on families and society → large supporters of the
	- ==Dry  communities==: regions where alcohol is banned
- **Prostitution** - ==White Slavery:== anti-prostitution movement sparked by rumors that women were sold into sex trade through prostitution
	- ==White Slave Traffic Act (Mann Act)== (1910): criminalized the transportation "of any woman or girl for the purpose of prostitution or debauchery, or for any other immoral purpose"
- [[The Gilded Age#^915cd1|Brandeis Brief]]
#### Progressive challenges to racial discrimination
- Booker T. Washington believed the way to deal w/ the ongoing assault was to (somewhat) accommodate (==accommodationist==)to the white beliefs to ensure black safety. Argued that African Americans must concentrate on educating themselves in learning useful trades and investing in their own businesses. Hard work would prove the value of blacks to the American economy ^e691bf
	- Atlanta Compromise - [[The Atlanta Exposition Address|"Cast Down Your Bucket"]]
- ==Anti-Bookerites== - "Niagara Movement" and the creation of the NAACP. Economic rights must be coupled with full civil and political rights. Strongly disagreed w/ Washington. Led by DuBois → believed blacks needed full civil and political rights, no accommodation
	- "The way for a people to gain their reasonable rights is to not by voluntarily throwing them away" - DuBois  ^a7d075
#### "Social Housekeeping" / Birth Control / Suffrage and Feminism
- Utilitarian argument ([[The Gilded Age#^dd299f|Maternalism]]), argues for rights based on women's special, even superior traits as guardians of the family. Women's morality would humanize society
- Jane Addams on ==Civic Housekeeping==: called on women – especially middle class women w/ leisure and energy, as well as rich philanthropists – to exercise their civic duty to become involved in municipal affairs  ^85eaf2
- Feminists make a rights based argument → women as **women** – not soldier, not housekeepers –  deserve equal rights because they are American citizens. Emphasis on economic and sexual independence; unpaid female labor is common despite the fact that they make an important economic impact
	- Margret Sanger's *Women and Economics* argue that industrial labor wouldn't be possible w/o women. Also advocates for the distribution of sex and contraception, pushed for the legalization of birth control
- ==National Women's Party==, Harriet Stanton Blatch, Alice Paul: imprisoned for chaining themselves to the gates of the White House, resulting in going on a hunger strike, which creates a large PR problem → leads to Wilson being forced to pass the 19th Amendment
- ==19th Amendment==: gives women the legal right to vote ^c9260a
### Imperialism (1865 - 1914)
#### Anti-Imperialists
- Mark Twain, William Jennings Bryan, William Graham Sumner, Jane Addams, Andrew Carnegie, Samuel Gompers (leader of [[March MCQ WIKI#^fe0c73|AFL]])
	- Conquest of people against their will violates US principles of self-determination (DEMOCRACY) - US "puking up its heritage"
	- American character being corrupted by militarism inherent in imperialism
	- Double standard, democracy abroad, [[The Gilded Age#^74a875|Chinese exclusion act]], Jim Crow laws, [[The West#^10886a|Native forced assimilation at home]]
- ==US - Philippine War== (1899 - 1902): US use of concentration camps, attacks on women & children led to large loss of life for Filipinos. Finally gained full independence in 1946
#### Foreign policy elite
- Dominated by the ==Foreign policy elite==: Henry Adams (historian, JQA's grandson), John Hay (credited w/ Open Door policy), TDR, Henry Cabot Lodge (senator), Elihu Root (Secretary of war and SOS)
- Why? Profits.   Foreign markets also a "safety valve" and assist w/ overproduction, unemployment due to underconsumption, economic depression from cyclical economy, and social tensions resulting from all of the above
- Also, surge in nationalism,  belief in [[The Gilded Age#^3aef5f|Social Darwinism]] comingled w/ paternalism and racism (US as Anglo-Americans should be a civilizing force on the world), and American exceptionalism, worries about the "closing of the frontier"
	- Josiah Strong, *Our Country*, updates exceptionalism for a new day
#### Expansion
- William Seward (Secretary of State during Lincoln's presidency, 1861 - 1869): wants a US empire in the Western Hemisphere stretching across the Pacific ocean ^1dfd25
	- Tries to annex Virgin Islands
	- Purchases Alaska - ==Seward's Icebox== - $7.2bn
	- Claimed Midway
	- Eyeballing Hawaii
- Alfred T. Mahan, *The Influence of Sea Power Upon History*: states the US needs foreign markets, and must have coaling statins and naval bases to reach the foreign markets, must have a larger protective navy, must have a professional class of foreign service works   ^d3ee72
- TDR built the ==Great White Fleet== → naval fleet that the US toured around the world ^4eb2b2
#### Hawaii
- 1890 - Americans in Hawaii owned $\frac{3}{4}$ of Hawaii's wealth despite being only 2.1% of the population. Hawaiian sugar exports entered the US duty free
	- They had forced the king to accept a constitution that allowed foreigners the right to vote and shifted power to the legislature
	- 1890 - ==McKinley Tariff== eliminated the duty-free status of Hawaiian sugar
	- American elite on island pushed for annexation
	- New queen, Lili'ukoalani, wanted to regain power from American elite
	- 1893: Queen Lili'uoaklani arrested, forced to cede power - gives it to US govt. instead of Annexation club
	- Cleveland suspicious and everything on hold until SPAM
![Atlas Map: The American Empire, c. 1900|500](https://wps.pearsoncustom.com/wps/media/objects/5407/5537171/atlas/Resources/sm_ah4_m006.jpg)
#### Cuba
- More than 9% of Cuban sugar was exported to the US duty free until the 1894 ==Wilson-Gorman Tariff== → lose their duty free status. US investments in Cuba totaled more than $50 million
- ==Cuba Libre==: Spanish General Valeriano Weyler created "reconcentration camps " ^925573
- Amid continuing unrest, US sends the USS Maine
	- It blows up in the Havana Harbor → U.S knows it wasn't Spain but they're blamed anyways
- ==Teller Amendment==:  that once Cuba was freed from Spanish control, the United States would not seek to exercise permanent control over the island → US wouldn't annex! ^c31250
- USA has a military base called "Gitmo" where they hold captives - don't need to comply to US constitutional jail rights
- ==Spanish American Cuban Filipino Guamian War==
	- As much about acquiring Spain's island empire as it was about Cuban independence
	- Motives: humanitarian impulse ([[#^925573|thanks to depiction of reconcentration camps in yellow newspapers]]), concern for commerce and American property in Cuba, and desire to monopolize markets in Cuba, fulfill expansionist dreams
- General Dewey strikes first… in Manila?
- War was over by August (begun in late April)
- ★ ==Treaty of Paris==: Cuba is independent, under protection of the US, who gains Philippines, Puerto Rico, Guam. Philippines and Guam act as important coaling and naval stations on the way to the "open door" in China, Puerto Rico protects a canal zone
#### Open door policy
^808489
- Fall of the Qing Dynasty, rise of JP, led to carving up of China → "spheres of influence"
- US entered the scene late
- John Hay, SOS and member of foreign policy elite, created the ==Open Door policy== asking European powers to respect the principles of free trade
	- Europe says "Oh Hecky Nah" …until the US assists in the Boxer Rebellion
- Pattern: US will intervene to protect economic interests and free trade (over and over) → domestic wellbeing requires exports, so the US must intervene to protect foreign trade & keep markets open, any closing of an area to American products is seen as threatening the survival of the US itself.
	- US has done this multiple times and will continue to do so: China, Cuba, Philippines,..
#### TR's World
- [[Progressive Era#^d1f355|Theodore Roosevelt:]] progressive & imperialist president → assistant secretary of the Navy, Rough Riders, VP, President, Bull Moose
	- "Speak softly, carry a big stick, and you will go far "
- Emphasis on 2 strategic areas
	1. Development of US navy (big supporter of [[#^d3ee72|The Influence of Sea Power Upon History]])
	2. Importance of Latin America and reaffirmation of an American sphere of influence
- During his presidency, US built 11 battleships - and sent "Great White Fleet" on a world tour from 1907 - 1909
- ==Gunboat diplomacy==: sending naval forces and the marines into a national capital to temporarily seize control of the govt, protecting American and Western personnel and dictating policies friendly to American business ^4be795
#### Roosevelt corollary
- ★ ==Platt Amendment==: Cuba can't make treaties that impair their independence (US must approve Cuban foreign treaties), US has the right to intervene to secure Cuban independence, Cuba has to lease Guantanamo Bay to US as a military base
![[S1 Wiki(APUSH.)#^f4180d]] ^ff6210
- ==Roosevelt Corollary==: US wanted to support stable, prosperous states in Latin America that live up to their political and financial obligations… And create or enforce that stability when it didn't exist. US found that govt. mismanagement, civil wars, military coups, turnover in regimes created insecure environments for US business, and invited European intervention **therefore, the US will engage in preemptive attack and intervene in any Latin American nation whose behavior puts it in danger of defaulting on loans or "inviting" European intervention** → intervenes to ensure favorable political/economic govt. for their workers  ^6f23bc
#### US intervention in Mexico
1. Revolution in 1910 overthrows President Porfirio Diaz
2. Destabilizes country and panics American capitalists who have investments there
3. US refuses to recognize Victoriano Huerta, who had executed democratically elected Francisco Madero
4. US invaded port city of Veracruz to stop it from receiving shipment of arms for Huerta's government ⇒ Huerta overthrown. US supports Venustiano Carranza, but, Pancho Villa engages in raids on the US border
	1. General John J. Pershing can't seem to catch him or stop the raids on US soil
- **Recurring pattern: US willing to intervene militarily in Latin American affairs to protect US economic interests in the region**
#### Dollar diplomacy
^2117c6
- US govt encouraged private bankers to provide loans to China and Latin American nations to modernize and bring these countries into American sphere of influence. But, this gave the US more control over their national fiscal affairs. Taft and Wilson also used it
- ==Panama Canal==: US needs a way to move merchant goods & troops w/o going around South America (England backs out of partnership), then incite revolutionaries in Panama to revolt against Colombian control in return for fiscal control/canal
- ★ ==Hay Pauncefote Treaty==: provided for unrestricted submarine cable construction and operation by either country in any part of the world. Also gave the United States exclusive rights to build and control a canal across Central America for any purpose it chose.
#### Japan
- US/Japan on collision course as both follow imperialist policies in Asia
- [[#^4eb2b2|Great White Fleet]] led Japan to increase their naval fleet as well
- ★ ==Taft-Katsura Agreement==: conceded Japanese hegemony over Korea in return for Japan's pledge not to undermine the U.S position in the Philippines
- ★ ==Root-Takahira Agreement==: US recognized Japan's interests in Manchuria,…
### WWI (1914 - 1920)
#### Entangling Alliances
- ==Triple Alliance==: Germany, Austria-Hungary, Italy (original German alliance)
- ==Triple Entente==: UK, RU, FR
- The beginning of World War I was sparked by the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary on June 28, 1914, in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. This event was the catalyst for Austria-Hungary to declare war on Serbia. In response, Russia began to mobilize its troops and Germany declared war on Russia and France shortly after. Great Britain then declared war on Germany, thus beginning World War I.
	- Austria-Hungary declares war on Serbia b/c of the assassination, and Russia declares war on Austria-Hungary to protect Slavic allies, and the rest of the triple entente joins
#### Neutrality in hearts and minds, but not in business
- Ethnic tensions within the U.S b/c of immigration
- But, worries that if Germany won, and therefore dominated Europe, their militarism would be bad for US business there and in European colonies around the world
- 1914 - 1916, US exports to UK & FR increase 365%
- Exports to Germany (largely due to English blockade) drop by 90%, from $345 million to $29 million
- Loans: private American banks loaned $2.3 billion to Britain and France, $27 million to Germany … lopsided neutrality
- Wilson has bad civil liberties record:, puts limits on free speech & press. Didn't allow any dissent, incl. socialist dissent
#### Violation of neutral rights?
- Britain, "ruling the waves and waiving the rules"
- Germany responded w/ Unterseebooten (U-Boats) and unrestricted submarined warfare
- **Lusitania (May 7, 1915)**
	- Germany agrees to use restricted submarined warfare after the sinking of the Lusitania, but returns to it in **February 1917**
	- Germany WARNED the U.S that no citizens should board the Lusitania in a newspaper, but U.S still gets pissy when Americans in the Lusitania die (idiots)
	- ==Zimmerman Telegram==: secret diplomatic communication sent by the German Empire's Foreign Secretary Arthur Zimmermann to Mexico in January 1917. It proposed an alliance between Germany and Mexico in the event that the United States entered World War I on the side of the Allies. The telegram was intercepted and decoded by British intelligence and its contents leaked to the press in the US, helping to sway public opinion in favor of US involvement in WWI
- US moved to armed neutrality, declared war on April 2, 1917
- ==Selective Service Act==: required all males between the ages of 21-30 to register for WWI.
#### Wilsonianism
- **Will be the basis of 14 points, but notice the emphasis on American Exceptionalism** ^77600f
	1. Open diplomacy without secret treaties  
	2. Economic free trade on the seas during war and peace  
	3. Equal trade conditions  
	4. Decrease armaments among all nations  
	5. Adjust colonial claims  
	6. Evacuation of all Central Powers from Russia and allow it to define its own independence  
	7. Belgium to be evacuated and restored  
	8. Return of Alsace-Lorraine region and all French territories  
	9. Readjust Italian borders  
	10. Austria-Hungary to be provided an opportunity for self-determination  
	11. Redraw the borders of the Balkan region creating Roumania, Serbia and Montenegro  
	12. Creation of a Turkish state with guaranteed free trade in the Dardanelles  
	13. Creation of an independent Polish state  
	14. Creation of the league of nations
- President Wilson’s insistence on the inclusion of the League of Nations in the Treaty of Versailles (the settlement with Germany) forced him to compromise with Allied leaders on the other points. Japan, for example, was granted authority over former German territory in China, and self-determination—an idea seized upon by those living under imperial rule throughout Asia and Africa—was only applied to Europe. Following the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, Wilson returned to the United States and presented it to the Senate.
#### Bolshevik Revolution and the 14 points
- November 1917: Lenin's Bolshevik forces succeeded in overthrowing Aleksander Kerensky's liberal-democratic government
	- Lenin's government published Alllied secret agreements, including those dividing up the colonies and territories of the Central Powers
- Wilson responded w/ the 14 points → a reiteration of Wilsonianism and US war aims ^79d8a3
	- Diplomacy in the public view
	- Freedom of seas
	- Lower tariffs
	- Arms reduction
	- Decolonization of empires
	- Evacuation of foreign troops from Russia, Belgium, FR
	- Self-determination of nationalities in Europe, create a League of Nations
- ==Treaty of Brest-Litovsk== (1918): Russia loses Poland, Finland, Baltic States, and Ukraine becomes independent
#### Mobilizing the home front
- ==National Act of 1916==: increases army and natl. guard
- ==Navy Act of 1916==: begins expansion of navy
- The draft allows the government to move certain people where they're supposed to be
- ==War Industries Board==: coordinated military purchasing and ensured production efficiency along w/ supplying the military. Among other things, it made purchases, allocated supplies, fixed prices, standardized goods
#### Civil Liberties
- ==Committee on public information:==  The Committee on Public Information (CPI) was a U.S. government agency created in 1917 to coordinate and promote public support for U.S. involvement in World War I. The CPI was headed by journalist George Creel, who had been appointed by President Woodrow Wilson to lead the organization. The committee employed a wide range of tactics to promote its messages, including press releases, posters, pamphlets, and motion pictures. It also sponsored speaking tours of prominent Americans such as famous aviator Eddie Rickenbacker and Hollywood actor Charlie Chaplin in order to bolster public enthusiasm for the war effort. The CPI's work was so successful that it continued operating until the end of the war in 1918. Although it is remembered as an example of wartime propaganda, the CPI also helped introduce modern advertising techniques and public relations strategies that are still used today.
- ==Four-minute men:== in charge of "four minute updates" to spread the news of how the war is going to the public. Emphasis on =="dropping the hyphen"== → meaning that you are just American, rather than a German-American or an Irish-American
	- =="100% Americanism":== similar to dropping the hyphen; if you're American, you're only American
- ==Espionage act:== the first statute forbade "false statements" designed to impede the draft or promote military subordination. Banned from mails materials considered treasonous
- ==Sedition Act:== unlawful to obstruct the sale of war bonds and to use "disloyal, profane, scurrilous, or abusive" language to describe the government, the Constitution, the flag, or the military uniform
### Post-war America
#### Economic Expansion & a consumer society
- ==Corporate consolidation==: growth of monopolies
- Agriculture is in serious trouble
- Tariffs keep going up ⇒ ==Fordney-McCucumber Tariff==: imposed high protective tariffs on imported goods. Helped create a boom in the American economy in the 1920s as it allowed American business to thrive w/o fear of competition from foreign source
- Govt. "regulation" [[#^fd11f4|FTC and ICC]] move to a cooperative, non-regulated relationship w/ businesses
#### Labor pendulum
- Gilded age = Freedom of Contract, [[Progressive Era]] ⇒ Square Deal
==Coronado Coal Company v. United Mine Workers==:  S.C concluded that a striking union could be prosecuted for illegal restraint of trade
- ==Maple Floor Association v. US==: court decided that trade associations that distributed anti-union info were not acting in restraint of trade (DOUBLE STANDARD?)
- ==Bailey v. Drexel Furniture==: child labor laws should be state-enforced, rather than federally
- ==Adkins v. Children's Hospital==: S.C struck down a D.C minimum wage law b/c it violated the "freedom contract" right within
- ==Yellow dog contracts==: contracts that state if an employee is hired, they cannot join a union
- ==Welfare capitalism==: improve conditions so that there's no need for Unions (employed by Ford )
- ==Governor Coolidge + Massachusetts police strike==:  In response to the Massachusetts police strike of 1919, Governor Calvin Coolidge firmly asserted that “there is no right to strike against the public safety by anybody, anywhere, anytime.”
#### Foreign policy in the [[Interwar Period]]
- Characterized by a U.S "return" to isolationism ([[S1 Wiki(APUSH.)#^f4180d|Monroe Doctrine]])
- ==Treaty of Versailles==: peace conference to outline the conditions of peace between Germany and its allies
![[#^79d8a3]]
- ==League of Nations==: Wilson's primary goal for the conference, create an international alliance between allied countries, with **collective defense**
		- ==Article 10==: section of the League of Nations defining collective defense
	- ==Separate peace==: agreement to cease military hostilities with another even though the former country had previously entered into a military alliance with other states that remain at war with the latter country
	- **Outcomes:** **(1)** Germany surrenders all colonies in Africa, Asia, Pacific, reduces military, must pay reparations; **(2)** created the independent states of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Austria, Hungary, and more
	- Congress refused to ratify the Treaty of Versailles b/c they disagreed with the League of Nations, primarily Article 10 b/c it eliminated the country's policy of nonalignment
- ==Washington Naval Conference==: called by Harding to maintain peace and disarmament between US, JP, IT, BE, PT, FR, NE
	- ==5 Power Treaty==: signed in 1922 by the United States, Great Britain, Japan, France, and Italy, which limited the naval arms race among these countries in the aftermath of World War I. Banned construction of battleships for 10 years.
	- ==9 Power Treaty==: marked the internationalization of the [[March MCQ WIKI#^808489|Open Door Policy]] & recognized China's sovereignty
	- ==4 Power Treaty==: US, JP, GB, FR agreeing to respect each other's pacific holdings
- ==Locarno Pact of 1925==:  DE, FR, BE, IT, GB mutually guaranteed peace in western Europe
- ==Kellogg Briand Pact of 1928==: agreement between US, FR, GB renouncing the use of war as a means of settling international disputes, declared that war is no longer a legitimate tool of national policy
#### African Americans
- ==Great Migration==: the boll weevil destroyed crops throughout the South, leading sharecroppers (blacks) to leave the land, primarily to migrate to the North (and some to [[The West]]). Other reasons include the implementation of Poll Taxes & Jim Crow Laws
	- ==Marcus Garvey==: believes there should be a separation between whites & blacks. Whites fucked up society, and they aren't worthy of collaboration
		- Government sees him as very radical & eventually has him killed
		- Created multiple different businesses supported by blacks, took them on cruises, etc.
- ==Harlem Renaissance==: culture of blacks living in Harlem creating their own culture, independent from white influence. Lots of poetry, creative writing

#### Reactions to the forces of modernity
- **KKK returns**
	- Natives, white, protestant supremacy
	- Anti-immigrant, white supremacist, anti-Catholic, anti-Jewish
	- Use sales tactics to appeal to a wider audience, causing the base of the KKK to be spread further than just the south
- Nicolas Sacco & Bartolomeo Vanzetti: two anarchist Italian immigrants who were wrongfully imprisoned for murder (put to death?). Used as fuel for the anti-immigration cause
- ==Emergency Quote Act (1921)==: restricted the number of immigrants admitted from any country to 3% of the number of residents from that country living in the US. All Asians were banned from immigrating to the US (for 10 years?)
- ==National Origins Act (1924)==: limited the number of immigrants that could be admitted to the U.S to 2% of the 1819 census ^e37623
- ==Fundamentalism==: wave of people returning to evangelical & traditional beliefs. **Interpret the bible as LITERALLY**, very anti-evolution
- ==Scopes Trial==: defendant was a teacher who taught evolution where it was illegal (TN), was done purposefully in order to gain attention from the press, and highlight the illogical reasoning of fundamentalists
Calvin Coolidge (V.P for Harding) takes over (who SUCKED) when Harding dies, and he believed in a small government. It should act as a partner with business

#### Causes of the Great Depression
1. Speculation
2. Foreign debt triangle ⇒ **if one of these pieces fail, the economy goes down with it**
	- U.S is losing money giving money to Germany to prevent revolution
	- Germany uses this money to pay reparations
	- European countries are using these reparations to pay America back
3. Stock market crash is a RESULT of the Great Depression
4. Corporate debt
5. **Declining demand and underconsumption**
6. Buying stocks on margin
7. Corporate debt
8. ==Johnson Act (1934)==: U.S congress declares that if any European country defaults on a loan to the US, they'll never get another loan again
9. Lack of federal regulation
#### Herbert Hoover (BAD)
- Opens the door to the government taking a more active stance in helping the economy when it's in trouble
- ==Associationism==: government and business should work together to set higher minimum wages, industry hours, etc.
- ==President's Organization for Unemployment Relief== (POUR): private philanthropy group led by corporate leaders providing money to the poor.
- "It's not the function of the government to relieve individuals of their responsibilities to their neighbors. Ask the people in your community" ⇒ **not the business of the government to provide handouts**
- Eventually creates small public works projects funded by the federal government, setting people back to work; however, they were too small
- ==Hawley-Smoot Tariff==: raised tariffs on some goods up to 40%
- ==Reconstruction Finance Corporation==: agency created to loan money to assist ailing banks, railroads, and other institutions. However it failed b/c its actions were on too small a scale to have any effect
- Built up the federal reserve
#### Public loses faith
- ==Bonus Army==: group of veterans want their money early and begin a march with their families on Washington until they reach their destination and set up "Hoovervilles" ⇒ Hoover calls in several military regiments.
- ==Franklin Delano Roosevelt==: supports direct relief payments for the unemployed, wants a "new deal"
	- Runs as a Democrat b/c the Republicans FUCKED UP the 1920s ⇒ **causes a party switch: Democrats are now the party of federal aid**
- ==Banking Holiday==: closes every bank in the country for four days, checks bank records, and the only banks that reopen are the ones that have the support
- ==Emergency Banking Relief Act==: allows the twelve Federal Reserve Banks to issue additional currency on good assets and thus the banks that reopen will be able to meet every legitimate call
	- Creates the ==FDIC=== to support the "common man's investment"P
- FDR uses the radio to communicate with citizens directly, proving that they're in a ==crisis of confidence==

#### The New Deal and …
- **Opposition**
	- Al Smith, ==American Liberty League==: economic conservatives in Democratic Party who thought the government aid was too much
	- Father Charles Coughlin, Dr. Francis Townshend, ==Old Age insurance==: $200 a month paid for w/ transition tax
	- Huey Long, ==Share Our Wealth Society==: $200 for every American every year, few thousand to every American for housing a few times in their life
	- U.S communist party: increased in popularity as some believed the government aid that had been given to them wasn't enough
- The first ever "==sit down strike==" occurred @ GM/Ford factories in Flint, in which workers entered the factory and refused to move, despite the risk of being penalized or fined. After 45 days the plants agreed to recognize their Union, primarily b/c Michigan's governor refused to send in the national guard

$^{1:}$ The Wagner Act's purpose was to strengthen Section 7a of the NIRA, which allowed for the creation of unions. The NIRA had been declared unconstitutional, except for section Section 7a, but the provision was too weak to stand on its own. Businesses found loopholes to circumvent it, thus the need for the Wagner Act

- Parties realigned in 1932 because of FDR's leadership and his response to the Great Depression
- ==Court Packing Plan==
	- FDR tries to appoint up to 6 new justices so that his Social Security Act isn't declared unconstitutional, and congress dislikes this, so they drop support for his legislation, essentially ending the New Deal
- FDR tries to cut back on government spending, causing a recession to occur during the middle of the depression, called the Roosevelt depression ⇒ Depression + Recession (unemployment) = BAD
- The New Deal coalition was a political alliance formed in the United States during the Great Depression, which brought together various groups, including urban workers, ethnic minorities, farmers, and southern Democrats. The coalition supported President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal programs aimed at stimulating economic recovery and providing social welfare benefits. It helped to reshape American politics by creating a new base of support for the Democratic Party that would last for several decades.

		- LOOPHOLE: US is able to lease or "give away" money/arms to friendly countries
- US response to Jewish refugees? Poor at best… US maintained immigrant restrictions under the [[#^e37623|National Origins Act]] ⇒ refugees come to the US after almost being killed, and they refuse to let him in

	-  ==Kristallnacht== - Crystal Night: destruction of Jewish owned businesses, before Germany bans Jews the right to own businesses and beginning hella discrimination
	- Italy sacrifices their rights to get unity and order
	- ==Anschluss== (AS) - DE annexes Austria
