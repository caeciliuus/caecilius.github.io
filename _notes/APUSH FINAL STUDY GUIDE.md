# I: The Colonial Era
#### Spanish model of colonization
  - Crown rules colonies autonomously
  - Men comprise most of the colonies & take native women as their wives
#### Columbian Exchange
  - Europe → Americas: smallpox, domesticated animals, sugar, wheat, rye
  - Americas → Europe: corn, potatoes, tobacco, beans, squash, peppers, cacao
![[Pasted image 20230112201845.png|500]]
- ==Treaty of Tordesillas:==  split new world between Spain & Portugal
- ==Encomienda:==  economic colonial system tying Natives to land owned by colonizers
- ==Syncretism:==  practice of connecting Christianity to native religions
- ==Black Legend:==  banned the use of enslaving natives in the colonies, causing Africans to be used instead
- ==House of Burgesses:==  first colonial congress ^78b565
#### English Reformation
  1. Martin Luther creates list of problems in the church, primarily sale of indulgences
     - ==Covenant of grace:==  protestant belief that one can go to heaven only if they believe in God
  2. ==Henry VIII==  creates Church of England so he can get a divorce
  3. Elizabeth I is tolerant of other faiths, brings reformation to the church
  4. Stuart Cousins ==James==  & ==Charles I==  seceded Elizabeth
     - No religious tolerance, believes in divine right of kings → begins Great Puritan migration
  5. Puritans that stay in England rise to overthrow Charles & begin the English Civil War. Charles is overthrown
  6. ==Charles II==  begins restoration, gives US land to his supporters (proprietorship)
  7. James II takes power after Charles II dies w/o an hear. Glorious revolution begins (James dips → France) & constitutional monarchy is created
  - ==Puritans:==  wish to get rid of Catholic influence, no more iconoclasm, separate from government, elect members of Church
- ==John Winthrop:==  first governor of New England, created the model of Christian charity
  - Created idea that the Puritans are in a deal w/ God: he let them survive the journey over so they must be the best Christians possible for him (or hell will come?)
- ==Manifest Destiny:==  American territorial policy stating it was the people's duty to settle, conquer and prosper throughout the continent.  ^13767f
- Roger Williams buys RI, which he turns into a community based on religious tolerance, receives protection from English govt.
- ==Mercantilism:==  economic theory with heavy government involvement/stewardship in the economy. States that the world's wealth is finite: one nation gains, another loses  ^bb44b6
  - England sets this system up 2 ways: used colonies for cheap, raw materials then overcharge them for finished goods
- Mercantilism created the ==Atlantic Trade==  → USA sends cheap materials to England, receive overly-expensive manufactured goods in return
  - Slavery supports the trade: slaves, the materials they produce and the materials they require to survive are all traded
- Decrease in indentured servants available because **(1)** there's competition of where they will move and **(2)** England sends less indentured servants to the colonies
- ==Bacon's Rebellion:==  pivot point, marks the movement from indentured servants → African slaves. Indentured servants and slaves team up to burn Jamestown to the ground. Results in the government creating a race-based hierarchical system that'll prevent slaves from revolting

#### Steps taken to develop precept of black inferiority
  1. Establish black inferiority
  2. Establish white superiority
  3. Enforce the notions publicly
  4. Enforce notions via theology
#### Navigation Acts
  - Set of rules created in England to restrict colonies from having a free economy [[#^bb44b6  |(Mercantilism]]) sh colonial merchants & ships can trade within colonies
  1. Certain BNA goods can only be traded within empire
  2. All foreign goods imported into colonies must step into English part to be traded
  3. ==Vice Admiralty Courts==  created → those who were tried for smuggling were forced to be in an English court w/o a jury. Violates the Magna Carta  
  - Colonies don't follow the rules so James II makes all the colonies into one large royal charter: ==The Dominion of New England==  
  - James is overthrown, making his daughter, Mary, & son-in-law, William of Orange, the rulers. They end the Dominion
#### Colonial culture
  - ==Enlightenment era:==  time when European thinkers challenged traditional views by applying scientific method
    - Rational reason understanding
  - ==John Locke:==  **(1)** ==Tabula Rasa:==  essay concerning human understanding: no human is born innately good or sinful, we are a blank slate **(2)**  ==Two Treatises of Government:==  people should come together and form a social contract to create a government. Whole purpose of government is to protect <u>lives, liberty and pursuit of property</u>
#### Great Awakening
  - Rejection of rationalism @ the heart of enlightenment
  - Schism: ==Old Light==  (traditional Protestant branches) v. ==New Light Churches==  (emotional release into evangelical birth)
  - Consequences: pluralism (divisions), challenge traditional thought </span>, put emotion over learning, undermine recommended wisdom, dissent from consensus
- ==Glorious Revolution:==  James II was overthrown b/c he taxed cider without voter knowledge & converted to Catholicism
  - William & Mary agree to constitutional monarchy, create a bill of rights
- ==King William's War:==  fought in Europe but also America between French & English → first world war  
- ==Salem Witchcraft Crisis:==  reaction to the change happening in the colonies, Puritans believed it was punishment for breaking the covenant. Causes women to be targeted for "witchcraft"
- ==John Peter Zenger Case (1795):==  newspaper editor arrested for incl. an article criticizing NY governor → results in freedom of press
- ==Stono Rebellion (1739):==  enslaved Africans gathered and went around killing landowners b/c they were made to work on feast day
  - Raises concern about future rebellion, causing more laws to be created against slaves
#### French & Indian War
  - English need more land to grow crops & support increasingly growing population, so they look to OH. But PA, DE, and Dutch want it.
  - ==Albany Congress==  is called to hopefully ally w/ Iroquois, create Plan of Union to coordinate attacks, and an intercolonial govt.
    - ==Plan of Union==  says we should have royal governor in addition to intercolonial assembly. This doesn't work
  - Despite having the natives on their side, the French lose & give up all their NA continental holdings to the English, causing them to double their debt. ==Treaty of Paris==  ends war
    - Colonists get secure borders
    - Spain gets NE but loses FL
    - Natives can't play European powers against each other
  - ==Proclamation Line of 1763== : boundary line drawn along headwaters, marking the British American Colonies. Pisses off all the squatters

# II: Revolutionary Era 
#### Real vs. Virtual Representation
  - Colonists believe their representation is drawn from the constituency it represents: ==real representation== . They believe parliament can't represent t hem b/c they don't know needs or wants of individual colonies.
  - English believe that every member of parliament represents everyone in the empire: ==virtual representation==
- ==Real Whig ideology:==  powerful governments are dangerous, especially ones led by a monarch (republicanism!)
#### Revenue Acts (+ Currency Act)
  - ==Sugar act:==  reduced pre-existing 6 pence tax on molasses to 3 pence and will strictly enforce it (vice admiralty courts). This act was codified b/c colonists wouldn't pay pre-existing tax and would just bribe the customs officer
  - ==Currency acts:==  outlawed colonial issues of paper money
    - Colonial perspective: believe they could not maintain vigorous economic activity w/o their own currency
    - English perspective: English merchants were getting underpaid in colonial currency
#### Stamp Act
  - ==Stamp Act==  required tax stamps on printed materials, violators tried in Vice Admiralty Courts
  - ==Loyal 9:==  Boston artisans' club, hung effigy of Andrew Oliver & burned his brother-in-law's house on fire
  - ==Sons of Liberty:==  group that organized protests against England so no one's house is burned down again
  - ==Nonimportation associations:==  groups of colonial merchants that refused to import colonial goods
  - Stamp act is repealed but ==Declaratory Act==  is passed: legal for England to tax the colonies whenever they want
#### Townshend Acts
  - Charles Townshend creates a series of acts, ==Townshend Acts== , that violate mercantilism (colonies can just buy their own shit)
    1. Tax on items imported from Britain: glass, lead, paper, tea
    2. Parliament pays provincial officials
    3. Open additional vice-admiralty courts
  - ==Daughters of Liberty==  formed ^78166f
- ==Boston Massacre:==  Boston sees an increase in redcoats and tension breaks out between the guards & protestors. 5 die
- ==Tea Act:==  passed in response to the East Indies Company going bankrupt, makes the East Indies Company the sole provider of tea to the colonies. Angered colonists b/c they saw it as England trying to monopolize the colonies
  - Results in the ==Boston Tea Party:==  colonists pretend to be natives and force themselves on a boat, then destroy all the tea in Boston Harbor
#### Coercive (intolerable) Acts
  - Passed to punish the colonists for resistance
  1. ==Boston Port Act:==  port of Boston is closed until the British are compensated for the destroyed tea
  2. ==MA Govt. Act:==  replace governor elected by assembly with one apptd. by king, also no town meetings
  3. ==Justice Act:==  someone accused of murder in attempts to suppress a riot will be transported to a court outside the colonies
  4. ==Quartering Act:==  colonists must provide housing for British troops if needed → allows England to isolate revolutionaries
  5. ==Quebec Act:==  draws Quebec's boundary line further South, forcing colonists to go to Quebec (ew) to get land. Catholicism also allowed in Quebec
#### Continental Congress
  - First continental congress since Albany congress
  1. Define American Grievances
  2. Develop a plan for resistance
  3. Figure out a constitutional relationship w/ GB
  - Articles of Association/Continental Association
    - Nonimportation, nonexportation, nonconsumption
    - ==Committees of Observation and Inspection==  created to ensure that colonists are practicing nonimportation/exportation/consumption
- ==Lexington & Concord:==  British military try to siege Lexington & Concord but Paul Revere spreads the message. Moment that disagreement became war  
- ==Siege of Boston:==  British seized Boston but quickly withdrew  
#### British assumptions about war
  - Patriot forces can't withstand trained British military
    - Hire German mercenaries from Hess (Hessians)
  - Capturing major cities will result in the end of the war
  - Military vic roy = political vic roy
#### Second Continental Congress
  - Called to consider ministry's response to Continental Association
  1. De Facto government → extralegal; not illegal but not protected by law
  2. Printed money, foreign affairs, created a navy, strengthened militia, hired GW
  3. Olive Branch Petition: "if George III knew what was happening, he'd take their side" → NO LOL
  - Government needs legitimacy - Articles of Confederation; Continental Congress - Confederation Congress
#### Varieties of republicanism
  1. Classical: republics don't work when they're large, virtuous, led by a natural aristocracy of merit. Small republic means more are represented
  2. Economic: virtue doesn't last long, rational self-interest is inevitable, pursuit of private interests
  3. Egalitarian: govt. needs to respond to the needs of ordinary folk
- ==Patriots==  make up 2/5 of population: local merchants, members of dominant protestant groups, Chesapeake gentry,..
- ==Loyalists==  make up approx. 1/3 to 2/5 of population: ethnic minorities who want protection from British, tenant farmers, Anglican ministers,..
#### Major battles of the Revolutionary War
  1. ==❗Lexington & Concord== : moment @ which disagreement turned to war  
  2. ==❗Bunker Hill== : British attack in which Americans are dug in at top. Resulted in British withdrawal from Boston  
  3. ==Trenton/Princeton:==  Americans snuck on Hessians on Christmas, then on NYE  
  4. ==❗Saratoga:==  turned loyalist views around, become pro-revolution. First major British defeat of the war

       - ==Treaty of Amity & Commerce:==  France recognizes America as a nation, allows trade
       - ==Treaty of Alliance:==  no independent diplomacy, must work together
       - Becomes a global war: Netherlands w/ US & Spain w/ France (they want Gibraltar)
  5. ==❗Southern Campaign:==  British campaign attacking Southern colonies  
     - ==King's Mountain== : major setback for British southern strategy
     - ==Cowpens== : slowed British efforts to attack North Carolina
     - ==Guilford Court House== : militia, known to be weak, that caused a victory & huge loss of British life
  6. ==Battle of Yorktown:==  Cornwallis surrenders to focus on Jamaica  
#### Treaty of Paris of 1783
# III: A New State
  - Treaty ending the war
  - Ambassadors Ben Franklin, John Jay & John Adams were told to let France handle the negotiations but France didn't want to end the war, they wanted Gibraltar for Spain
  - ==Articles 4 & 5:==  allowed Britain to collect previous debt. Problematic as the federal government can't enforce taxes, only colonies
    - Return loyalist land (this doesn't happen)
#### Confederation Congress ^ef1486
  - One house, no power to regulate foreign trade, enforce laws, or tax, approval of 9 states required to enact laws, 13 states need to approve amendments to the Articles, no executive branch, no national court system
  - Main focus was foreign affairs, currency & postage system
  - Britain, France, Spain restrict trade for young US w/ Caribbean holdings. Didn't think they could handle their population
#### NW Territories
  - ==Northwest Ordinance of 1784:==  established a government for the NW territories, outlined process for admitting a new state into the Union.
  - Lands in NW territories were surveyed → townships 6 sq. mi. 36 sections, 640 acres each, $1 min price per acre
  - ==Bill of Rights, 1787==  guaranteed freedom of religion, right to jury trial, no cruel or unusual punishment, no slavery (but if a slave was caught escaping, they must return)
- ==Mount Vernon Convention (VA/MD)== : called to discuss navigational rights in common waterways → inspired collaboration
- ==Annapolis Convention:==  amend the articles to allow govt. to deal w/ crisis. Not many delegates come so the PA Convention is called to increase federal power
- ==Shay's Rebellion:==  armed uprising b/c MA raised taxes b/c legislators wanted to collect securities. Results in more delegates present @ PA Convention
#### Philadelphia Convention
  - ==VA Plan:==  presented by Edmund Randolph but written by Madison; "large state plan"
  - ==New Jersey Plan:==  William Patterson, "large state plan"
  - ==Connecticut Compromise:==  "great compromise" - Roger Sherman
  ![[Plans of government.canvas]]

#### Ratification
  - ==Federalists:==  younger men who believed in constitution, not concerned about tyranny
  - ==Classical Republicanism:==  belief stating that civil virtue must be learned. Religious moral based laws
  - ==Antifederalists:==  older citizens expressing a great concern that the constitution could create tyranny: Anglicans, backcountry farmers, Sam Adams, Patrick Henry,..
    - Heirs of the Real Whigs
    - ==Bill of Rights:==  document stating the guaranteed rights of freeborn Americans cannot be revoked
  - VA & NY are 2 states who voted against ratification. Ratification could still pass but 2 states w/ biggest economies not ratifying is significant
- ==Revenue Act:==  5% import duty → raise import tax, particularly on England so citizens can buy cheaper domestic goods
- Madison doesn't think a Bill of Rights is necessary but is forced to do it. Believes in explicit govt.
- ==Loose interpretation:==  loose understanding of the constitution → if it doesn't say you can't, you can
- ==Strict Interpretation:==  clearing up misconceptions about judiciary branch. No cap on # of justices
- ==Judiciary Act==: establishes justice system federally & statewide
  - 1 Supreme Court
  - 3 Appellate courts (now 13)
  - 13 District courts (94 now)

#### Washington's Cabinet, Hamilton's plans
- Alexander Hamilton created =="Report on Public Credit, 1790"==, analyzing financial standing of U.S, made recommendations to recover from post-war debt
  - Can't repudiate its debt b/c no one would loan money to the govt.
  - Going to redeem all the debt at **full face value,** then assume state debt & pay it @ full face value

| Attorney General      | Edmund Randolph  |
| -                     |                  |
#### First party system ^6b915b
  - Characterized by a lack of grass root organization → started @ top and slowly moved down
  - Hamilton's fiscal policies divide congress from one party system → two ^35c565
    -  ==Federalists:==  led by Hamilton & supported by Washington & John Adams. Support federalism & new financial system
    -  ==Democratic Republicans:==  led by Madison & Jefferson. Hate the financial system, supported by Antifederalists

^a3e4f5
- U.S is in awk position due to the French Revolution - need to pick a side
#### First political party system
  - ==Jay’s Treaty== : U.S is pissed at England because they: **(1)** haven’t withdrawn from the Great Lakes (violating article 4), **(2)** didn’t pay for the slaves they liberated, **(3)** seizing American vessels & cargo, **(4)** impressing American sailors (forcing them into the British navy) → “once a British subject, always a British subject”. John Jay becomes Ambassador for England, creates treaty:
    1. England withdraws from Great Lakes
    2. Pay for depreciations against American shipping
    3. Create tributary that England won't attack U.S ships, still doesn't stop the harassment; U.S not reimbursed for cost of runaway slaves
    4. Grant U.S trading privileges in UK
  - Leads to: **(1)** tensions w/ France **(2)** completely partisan vote → all federalists vote for it, no Democrats vote for it **(3)** War of 1812
- ==Pickney Treaty:==  treaty giving states permission to trade through the Mississippi River → "if you won't vote for Jay's Treaty, you can't vote for Pickney treaty"
- ==Election of 1796:==  runner up in the election was VP
#### Foreign affairs
  - 🇫‍🇷 fucks w/ 🇺‍🇸 and seizes their ships. U.S ambassador comes to France but is refused #foreignAffairs
  - ==XYZ Affair:==  3 US diplomats meet 3 French diplomats, who immediately ask for a bribe. This pisses off the 🇺‍🇸 → nickname the French diplomats "agent x/y/z" #foreignAffairs
  - ==Quasi War==  between America & France ensued. Not much conflict, just a series of naval battles in the Caribbean → France loses  
  - ==Convention of 1800:==  ends the Franco-American alliance, unbinding the countries from each other
#### Alien & Sedition Acts
  - Federalists pass a series of acts to keep immigrants out of the U.S b/c they make up the majority of Democratic Republicans
    1. ==Naturalization Act== : extends number of years to become a resident in the U.S to 12 years
    2. ==Alien Acts== : make it legal to imprison or exile enemy aliens
    3. ==Sedition Act== : cannot utter anything false, scandalous, or malicious about the government (violates freedom of speech 😟)
  - ==Virginia & Kentucky Resolutions:==  states have federal power to nullify a state's act within their borders. Jefferson & Madison make a pact in VA and KE to do so → ==nullification==
    ![[party split DR, F.canvas]]
- ==Republican Motherhood== : argument that women hold a crucial role in society - they raise the next generation of virtuous citizens → they need education
- ==Judith Sargent Murray== : key proponent in the fight for women’s education. Argues that women are of interior intellect since the beginning of time - uses example of Adam and Eve’s
- ==Abigail Adams==  pushes for more political inclusion but only talks to her husband John Adams → “Abigail’s Letters to John”. Highly educated
- Property owning women in New Jersey could vote in elections from 1776-1807
- ==Coverture== : when a men and a woman get married, the two become one and the women loses her identity  ^c325c6
- ==Gradual emancipation== (NY, PA, NJ, DE): after a certain debt, any child born into slavery will be freed on their next birthday ^ca33f8
- ==Voluntary Manumission== (VA, DE, MA): a slaveowner can choose to free slaves but they must relocate out of state
- ==Fries Rebellion:==  congress taxed land, houses and legal documents to fund Quasi War
- ==Gabriel's Rebellion:==  VA blacksmith, march on Richmond → plot uncovered ahead of time
- ==The (election) revolution of 1800:==  first peaceful exchange of power between two political parties in U.S history
- ==Jefferson/Burr vs John Adams/Charles Pinckney== : Jefferson & Adams tied and it goes to House of Reps → Jefferson wins & Democratic Republicans have control of the executive branch
- New treasury secretary is ==Albert Gallatin==  → drops Hamilton's financial plan and attempts to pay off debt by 1817 but doesn't succeed b/c of the War of 1812
  - Federalists "retreated to the Judiciary" → ==midnight appointments== : John Adams stays up all night before Jefferson takes office, commissioning  Federalist party members as judges
#### Judicial Review  ^aa572d
  - ==Marbury v. Madison== :  William Marbury sued Madison for declining to certify him to justice in District of Columbia. Federalist supported Supreme Court
    - Marshall ruled that Marbury had a right to the appt,  but the SC couldn’t make Madison honor it, so Marbury didn't get it. Established the SC's greater power to judge constitutionality of laws passed by congress → called ==Judicial Review==  
    - This gave the judicial branch a lot of power
#### Louisiana Purchase
  - Jefferson buys a lot of land, incl. New Orleans, from France w/ the goal of using New Orleans as a sugar refinery from Haiti. Export goods through Port of New Orleans #foreignAffairs
  - Napoleon gives U.S the land for $15 million, but the constitution doesn't explicitly state whether this is allowed (and Jefferson's morals)
  - ==Lewis & Clark Expedition:==  2 men explore the land bought b/c France didn't tell them about the boundaries
- Intl. slave trade ends in 1808 → ==African American Abolitionist Societies==  emerge (PA, NYC, MA)
  - ==American Colonization Society:==  Jefferson, Madison, Monroe. They were **not abolitionists**
#### Further Foreign Affairs (Quagmire?)
  - British kept impressing American citizens so the U.S retaliated
  - ==Non-Importation Act== : banned the import of British goods but exempted cloth and metal items → doesn't work b/c those are Britain's 2 biggest exports to the U.S #foreignAffairs
  - ==The Chesapeake Affair:== U.S.S Chesapeake is stopped by a British ship, who seize 4 men and hang 1. Angers the government greatly
    - Responded w/ the ==Embargo Act==  → the U.S won’t export anything to anybody; exports decline by 80% #foreignAffairs
  - ==Non-Intercourse Act of 1809== : ends trade with Britain and France #foreignAffairs
  - ==Macon’s Bill #2== : if England stops being a dick, the U.S will side with England; if France stops being a dick, the U.S will side with them #foreignAffairs
    - Both France & Britain say that they’ll stop (both lying), and the U.S sides w/ France and declares war on England (US wins)
  ![[war of 1812.canvas]]
#### The War of 1812
  - Shipbuilding races on the Great Lakes, burning down capitals & white houses
  - Fort Baltimore and Francis Scott Key
  - ==Treaty of Ghent==  - Status Quo: treaty ending the war
    - Pivoted the U.S to be considered as a nation
    - Shift from agricultural to market economy
    - Birth of the one party system
  - ==Hartford Convention:==  the end of the national arena for the Federalists (end first party system, begin Era of Good Feelings)
    - Federalists want an amendment to reduce the power of the federal government
    - Also want to reduce the power of VA → a president can't come from the same state twice in a row
  - ==Era of Good Feelings:==  first depression caused by the creation of a capitalistic economy
#### Early industrialism
  - ==Boston Manufacturing Company:==  Francis Cabot Lowell sketched British textile factories from memory and brought all phases of textile manufacturing together
  - Boarding houses for workers in Lowell MA. American industrialists envisioned America industrializing w/o the poverty and degradation seen in Europe
- Boarding houses for workers in Lowell MA. American industrialists envisioned America industrializing w/o the poverty and degradation seen in Europe
#### Era of Good Feelings
  %%cartridge rip 01/15/23 @ 1:07AM%%
  - End of the first party system
  - Lack of partisan discord (until 1824..)
  - Limits to how good you can feel when …
  - ==Panic of 1819==  (bank failures)
  - ==Missouri Compromise== : Henry Clay put forward a compromise in 1820: ME & MO will both join union, MO as a slave state, maintaining balance between slave & free states. Slavery prohibited forever north of MO’s border ^86bca6
    - Almost unravels when MO submits a constitution barring blacks from entering the state
- Pre-industrial → mixed economy
- ==Inside/outside societal structure:==  men did all the outdoor work (fields, herding, firewood, fishing, hunting); women did the “inside” work (gardens, milking, chickens, spinning, weaving, preserving food, meals, cloth, childcare)
- When the means of production leave the home, the traditional workers leave with it. Women go to weave, men go to factories
- Factories used a “==outwork system== ” for women → owners give the women cloth before they leave & if they come the next day with clothes ready, they get $
- ==Slater & Lowell== : Americans who see the factories in England, draws pictures of all the machinery, then brings it back to the U.S. Puts all the means of production under one roof
- At the ==Hartford Convention,==  Federalists look to limit the power of the federal government, especially the South's power and its ability to declare war
- After the war, the flip/flop continued and the now Democratic Republicans wanted to strengthen the federal government
#### Henry Clay's American System   ^820330
  1. National bank → ==Second Bank of the United States==
  2. International improvements to connect the nation → only part of this system that doesn't pass
  3. ==Tarif of 1816:==  tariff to protect manufacturing #foreignAffairs
     - Stimulate N.E economy while South & West’s agricultural products would feed N.E mills and workers. Goods would move in all directions, natl. bank would handle transactions
  4. Madison enacted much nationalist programs: ==Second Bank of the U.S==

#### Separate Spheres Ideology
^d5cffa
  - First workforce out the door is women, then the growing middle class follows. No longer indoor/outdoor work; redefined what it meant to be a family
    - Men: public sphere, provide and protect families. Men responsible for capitalism, public life, cyclical economy
    - Women: private/domestic sphere, moral compass and guardians, nurtured and guarded the family’s morality. Women are responsible for the country’s morals, the home, raise & educate children
  - Home moves from being a **center of production** →  **center of consumption** →  results in shrinking families but childhood becomes longer (as it becomes separated from production; avg. age of marriage was pushed back
  - _Previously_: republican motherhood, politicized women’s traditional roles → _Now_: resubmerge women in the home, women raise the next generation of virtuous citizens
#### 2nd Great Awakening
  - **what led to the second great awakening?**  The Second Great Awakening was a religious revitalization movement in the United States during the early 19th century. It began around the 1790s and lasted until the 1840s. The movement was fueled by a sense of spiritual disillusionment among some parts of society, a reaction to the Enlightenment’s emphasis on reason and science over faith. The Second Great Awakening was characterized by widespread revivals and conversions, an emphasis on personal piety and religious experience, and an increased interest in social reform. It also led to the formation of new Protestant denominations, such as the Mormons and Seventh-day Adventists. ^e1bd7e
  - 1790’s - 1830’s
  - “Hasten the Millennium”, eliminate the evil
  - All humans can achieve salvation (different in North & South). Man is a “free moral agent” → humans are perfectible
  - Rapid change fueled fears of social disorder (b/c of religion or policing the working class & immigrants?)
> [!Market Economy]
> - Immigration
> - A massive intended migration
   > - Capitalist economy - cyclical
   > - The way work is done is changing
> - Booms/busts
>> [!Leads to reform]
>> - Abolition
>> - Public education
>> - Female moral reform
>>- Temperance → reform
>> - Asylums → mental health exists
>> - **Penitentiaries**
>> 	- Philadelphia: isolation all the time
>> 	- Auburn: work together & isolation @ night
- ==Maine Law:==  illegal to sell, produce, or consume alcohol
  - Allows women to sue to divorce their husbands for chronic alcoholism
    - First reform to ==coverture==  → women are man's property & lose their individual identity when they get married
- ==Immediatists== : believe that slavery should be abolished immediately & use moral suasion to do so → act of persuading a person or group to act in a certain way through rational thinking
#### Election of 1824
  - ==Democrats:==  Members of the party that emerged from Jefferson’s Republican Party as one of the two dominant parties in the second party system
  - The Adams wing emerged as the National Republicans, and the Jacksonians became the Democrats; as an insurgent political force, they immediately began planning for 1828
  - As president, Adams proposed a strong nationalist policy incorporating Henry Clay’s American System, a program of protective tariffs, a national bank, and internal improvements.
  - Adams believed the federal government’s active role should extend to education, science, and the arts, and he proposed a national university in Washington, D.C.
  ![2nd political party system](2nd%20political%20party%20system.canvas)
  - 2nd party system characterized by lots of voter turnout b/c states removed property qualification
#### King Andrew I
  - Elected in 1829
  - Believes he is the heir to Jefferson → says he wants a “smaller government” but weakens the judicial & legislative branches
    - Used more vetoes than any other president combined
    - Doesn’t use White House cabinet, instead he uses his friends → called “kitchen cabinet”
    - Spoils system: replaced appointed officials w/ men who supported him
    - Ignores Supreme Court decision in **Cherokee/Worcester v. Georgia** and removes natives from _their_ land
> [!Nullification Crisis]
> - ==Virginia & Kentucky Resolution/Calhoun’s “Exposition and Protest"==: Calhoun builds on the resolutions, argues that states can nullify legislation they don’t believe it’s constitutional. Jackson doesn’t like this
> 	- ==Webster Hayne Debate== : Hayne (represents Calhoun) argues for immediate access to western land so that slavery can expand, Webster disagrees. Becomes a debate of slavery → Webster wins
> - South claims that the North can’t regulate slavery, says they can nullify laws if they want
> - ==Tariff of Abominations (1828):==  sought to protect northern and western agricultural products from competition with foreign imports but NC doesn’t argue against it because they hope Jackson will reverse it #foreignAffairs
> - ==Tariff of 1832== : set to reverse some of the effects of the Tariff of Abominations so NC nullifies both tariffs #foreignAffairs
> - Jackson to pass a ==Force act== , which would force SC to pay using the military. Causes Calhoun to resign his role as VP & join senate
> - Congress suggests to use the navy
- ==Dueling toasts== : Jackson speaks against nullification while Calhoun (his VP) supports it at the same dinner. Causes a ruckus
- ==Compromise Tariff of 1833== : both Calhoun and Clay create the Compromise Tariff of 1833 → reduces tariffs over 10 year period
  - Charter to expire in 1836: recharter early to embarrass Andrew Jackson, who doesn’t want a bank → plan backfires on Clay, Andrew Jackson vetoes the recharter & the public supports him
    - BUS notes circulated as national currency & could be redeemed for gold and silver. Bank acted as a clearing house for state banks, refusing to accept bank notes of any local bank that lacked sufficient gold reserves
  - ==Pet Banks== : one bank in each state to be the depository of federal funds
  - ==Deposit Act of 1836== : provided for the distribution of the federal surplus to the states in proportion to their population. You have to pay with gold & silver
  - Creates land bubble, which pops, then causing recession
#### Election of 1832
  - Democrats → Jackson & Van Buren ^f6cdb9
    - Jacksonians denounced the Bank of the United States as a vehicle for special privilege and economic power
  - National Republicans → Clay and John Sergeant
    - Republicans supported the Bank of the United States  as a pillar of their plan for economic nationalism
- ==Deposit Act of 1836:==  Authorizing the secretary of the treasury to designate one bank in each state and territory to provide services formerly performed by the B.U.S.
- South develops new defense of slavery: pivots from "necessary evil" to "positive good" defense
  - ==Necessary evil== : slavery is evil and bad but necessary for life in the South. Rev. Peter Fontaine: "land is cheap and plentiful while labor is scarce and expensive, so slavery is necessary"
  - ==Positive good== : paternalism, slave owners are the father while slaves are the grandchildren. Response to the North's reforms during the 2nd Great Awakening
    - Often called ==apologists==
    - George Fitzhugh – "Apologist": article defending African slavery
- ==Task system== : each slave was assigned a specific task to complete for the day. After they finished, their time was their own (BARELY MORE HUMANE)
- ==Nat Turner's Rebellion:==  slave rebellion against whites in VA. 60 whites killed in 48 hours → as many as 20 slaves killed in reprisals
#### Indian Removal
  - U.S was initially accommodating to the natives
  - In GA, there was an area belonging to Cherokees that they don't wanna give up (there's gold). Cherokee has a rule saying they don't have to sell their land but govt. makes them %%lmao%%
  - ==Indian Removal Act:==  federal funds for relocations (3/5 clause gave South power in the government)
#### Cherokees & Marshall's court

  - ==Cherokee Nation vs Georgia (1831):==  Backed by sympathetic whites but not by President Andrew Jackson, the Cherokees under Chief John Ross turned to the federal courts to defend their treaty with the United States
  - Neither a foreign nation nor a state, but Cherokee have a right to their lands
  - ==Worcester v. Georgia== : Marshall defined the Cherokee position more clearly. The Cherokee nation was a distinct political community in which “the laws of Georgia can have no force” and into which Georgians could not enter without permission or treaty privilege
  - Distinct political community
- ==Metropolitan industrialization== : when the piecework is sent to the home (in a city) to be completed by the next day → tenement sweatshops
- Commercialization of farming: need to be able to produce food w/ significantly lessened workforce → "agriculture remained the northern economy's backbone"
  - Mechanization: sowers, reapers, iron, steel plows
- Women send out all kinds of reformatory pamphlets via the mailing system (Andrew Jackson does not like this - bars them from using the USPS)
- ==American and Foreign Antislavery Society== : women removed from the movement, methodology of making changes within politics power
- William Lloyd Garrison & The Liberator created the ==American Anti-Slavery Society==  → controlled by women but inherently racist, use moral suasion to convince slaves to stop
#### Democrats v. Whigs
^49bf0a
  - In the 1830s, remnants of the National Republicans & Anti-Mason parties come together to become the Whigs
  - Whigs pushed for industrial & commercial development within the nation's current borders.
    - Vision of economic expansion demanded an activist govt., while Democrats reaffirmed the Jeffersonian principle of limited government. Also supported corporate charters, a natl. bank & paper currency.

^776a9f
- It is the country’s [[#^13767f |manifest destiny]] to expand the cotton → the term is coined
- USA is invited by Mexico to move into Texas, maintain duel citizenship. Mexico **(1)** allows them to use slavery, ****(2)**** can self-govern themselves. #foreignAffairs
  - US citizens want autonomy, so they revolt against the Mexican government & became independent → USA won’t annex it because no one wants to be on record supporting the expansion of slavery in the region
  - Polk runs for president, promises to buy California, take all of Oregon and a bit more, then annex Canada. If he gets the presidency, he’ll complete all these things, then won’t run for re-election as long as he gets everything he wants
- Polk gets Oregon (Oregon Treaty), then annexes Texas, then Mexico finally sells California to the USA #foreignAffairs
  - Polk provokes a war against Mexico, causing America to invade Mexico, where they take Mexico city
#### Mexican War: 1846 - 1848
  - ==Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo== : US gains CA, NM, present day NV, UT, AZ, parts of CO and WY
  - US paid claims to US citizens of $ 3.2 million (U.S citizens in Texas who have claims against Mexico for property damage),  $15 million to Mexico
  - ==Slave power conspiracy== : North believes this is evidence that slave powers in the South hold too much power in the government → in congress, judicial, executive. Concentration of slave power interest is what leads to the Mexican War
    - ==Wilmot Proviso== : never passed, states that slavery cannot be allowed in any territory gained from the Mexican War. Whigs wanted to pass this b/c they know it wouldn’t pass, proving that the Mexican American War was a slave power conspiracy
- Territories don't extend Missouri Compromise line
- ==Calhoun's State Sovereignty:==  says that individuals in each of the states have the right to use the territories equally (open to all American citizens) → if a Michigander can move to California and bring their belongings with him (property), then a South Carolinian can do the same, with their property INCLUDING their slaves
- ==Free Soil Party==  (not abolitionist): wage labor, no slave labor but they’re not abolitionist  ^32abaf
- ==Lewis Cass== : MI state governor, uses idea of Popular Sovereignty → people in territories can vote whether they want slavery or want
  - ==Charm of ambiguity== : states that a territory’s population cannot vote until it becomes a formal state
    - South want this b/c they want slavery to be established first
    - North wants the vote at any time the territory has a population large enough to have a territorial assembly
- ==Gold Rush== : young men setting off to CA to get gold, means that law and order needs to be implemented
# V: Civil War
#### Compromise of 1850
  - Slave trade abolished in Washington D.C
  - Texas boundary set, Texas gets $10 million for territory lost to NM territory
  - NM and UT  territories established by popular sovereignty
  - [[Chapter 12 - Politics and Fate of the Union, 1812-1859#^d099fa |Fugitive Slave Act]] strengthened (North responds w/ personal liberty laws), gave additional powers to slave owners to recapture slaves and angered northerners b requiring their complicity
    - Citizens can be deputized to join a search party for a runaway slave
    - $10 if a U.S marshal returns a fugitive to the South
    - There’s no requirement for a fugitive’s appearance, so free men from the North were being taken to the South to become slaves, even though they were born free ^e765e6
  - Slave TRADE illegal in D.C
  - CA joins union
- In the South, the disintegration of the Whig Party had left many southerners at loose ends politically. The security of their own communities seemed at stake, and in the 1850s, most formerly Whig slaveholders converted to the Democratic Party
#### Kansas Nebraska Act
  - Compromised compromises → nation at this point has relied on the Missouri Compromise, however Nebraska and Kansas were slave states
  - ==Stephen Douglas==  - Illinois Senator, wants to create a transcontinental railroad with a terminus in Chicago, has to gain southern support
    - Terminus in Chicago would anger the Southerners significantly, plus the RR would have to lay through Kansas, which isn’t settled
    - ==Kansas Nebraska Act== : Douglas overturns the Missouri Compromise, making the South happy, who then approve the building of the RR ^37fcac
    - Douglas gets rid of the [[#^86bca6 |Missouri Compromise]]because Kansas & Nebraska territory wasn’t settled & it didn’t have a climate susceptible for slave-produced crops
  - ==Border Ruffians==  (pro-slavery forces) cross over to Kansas to vote → Kansas and Nebraska slave stance is to be settled by popular sovereignty
- Consequences of the Kansas Nebraska Act: **(1)** end of the second party system/beginning of the third **(2)** Whig party falls apart - Northern & Southern Whigs can't work together ^d5064e
- ==Know Nothings== : anti-Catholic and anti-immigrant party whose influence peaked in the mid-1850s
- The [[#^d5064e |Kansas Nebraska Act]] spawned hatred and violence as land-hungry partisans in the sectional struggle clashed repeatedly in Kansas Territory. Abolitionists and religious groups sent in armed Free-Soil settlers; southerners sent in their reinforcements to establish slavery and prevent “northern hordes” from stealing Kansas
- In May, a proslavery posse sent to arrest the Free-Soil leaders sacked Kansas town of Lawrence, killing several people and destroying a hotel with a cannon.
- These passions brought violence to the U.S. Senate in May 1856, when ==Charles Sumner==  denounced “the Crime against Kansas” → Since he was radical in his anti-slavery views he got beat by a cane by Representative Preston Brooks
#### Republican Party
^c03e4a
  - Antislavery Whigs & Democrats, Free-Soilers, and other reformers throughout the old NW met to form the Republican party, a coalition dedicated to keeping slavery out of the territories
  - ![[Party systems.canvas]]
#### Dred Scott Case
  - ==Dred Scott==  and his wife, ==Harriet Robinson Scott== , sued for their freedom based on their former owner taking them for several years into Illinois, a free state, and to Fort Snelling in the Missouri Compromise. SC created multiple precedents w/ this case:
    1. Scott not a citizen of the US or MO
    2. Residence in a free state does not make you free
    3. Congress has no power to bar slavery from any territory
    4. African Americans have “no rights which the white man was bound to respect”
- ==John Brown’s Raid== : an unsuccessful attempt to start a slave revolution on the federal arsenal @ Harper’s Ferry. It resulted in the death of 10 people, including two of Brown's sons, and Brown himself was later hanged for treason
#### States secede
- SC is first state to secede and many states follow:
  ![[Pasted image 20230115214819.png |500]]

- Lincoln sought only to hold onto forts in the states that had left the Union, reasoning that in this way he could assert federal sovereignty while waiting for a restoration.
- ==George B. McClellan:==  Union general very popular with troops who proved better at organization and training at fighting
- ==Anaconda plan== : called for a blockade of southern ports and eventual capture of the Missouri River → “strangle” the Confederacy  
- ==Ulysses S. Grant:==  Union general who, in 1864, became Commanding General of the United States army
- ==Robert E. Lee:==  Confederate general who, in 1862, commanded the Army of Northern Virginia. In 1865 he became the general-in-chief of the Confederate army
- Davis desperately wanted European nations to recognize the Confederacy
#### Battles of the Civil War
  - *==Fort Sumter:==  Federal fort in Charleston harbor, South Carolina where the first shots of the Civil War were fired when the Union attempted to resupply troops  
  - *==Battle of Bull Run:==  first major land battle of the civil war. Half a million southerners volunteered to fight  
  - *==Battle of Shiloh:==  The bloodiest battle in American history to that date, and it happened in southern Tennessee  
  - *==Battle of Antietam:==  First major battle on northern soil. McClellan moved slowly, failed to use his larger forces in simultaneous attacks, and allowed Lee’s stricken army to retreat to safety across the Potomac  
  - ==Battle of Chancellorsville:==  decisive Confederate victory in the American Civil War, where Robert E. Lee and his army defeated the larger Union forces of Joseph Hooker.  
  - ==Battle of Vicksburg:==  Union vic roy that gave the North complete control of the Mississippi  
  - If Vicksburg fell, Union forces would control the river, cutting the Confederacy in 2 and gaining an open path → interior
  - *==Battle of Gettysburg:==  Union victory that halted the Confederate invasion of Pennsylvania; turning point in the war in the East  
	  - Vicksburg & Gettysburg (both intense battles w/ high casualty rates) forced General Kirby Smith to operate on his own
  - War finally ended in spring of 1865 @ the ==Surrender @ Appomattox==
- ==Peace Democrats:==  fought to regain power by blaming Lincoln for the war’s death toll, the expansion of federal powers, inflation and the high tariff, and the emancipation of black people
  - Its leaders called for an end to the war and reunion on the basis of “the Constitution as it is and the Union as it was

#### War transforms the South
  - One of the first traditions to fall was the southern preference for local and limited government. States’ rights had been a formative ideology for the Confederacy, but state governments were weak operations → Creation of a large govt. bureaucracy (==government girls== )

  - Faced with a critical shortage of troops, in April 1862 the Confederate government enacted the first national conscription (draft) law in American history. Thus, the war forced unprecedented change on states that had seceded out of fear of change
    - ==Confederate Draft==  - As their fortunes declined, people of once-modest means looked around and found abundant evidence that all classes were not sacrificing equally. The Confederate government enacted policies that decidedly favored the upper class.
    - Until the last year of war, for example, prosperous southerners could avoid military service by hiring substitutes.
  - Davis adopted a firm leadership role toward the Confederate Congress, which raised taxes and later passed a tax-in-kind - paid in farm products.
  - Davis further exhorted state governments to require farmers to switch from cash crops to food crops. But the army remained short of food and labor
  - The wives and mothers of soldiers now headed households and performed men’s work, including raising crops and tending animals.  

  - All arms, supplies & troops under national command
  - Suspended writ of habeas corpus (prevents individuals from being held w/o a trial
  - Impose martial law
  - Impressed slaves to work on fortifications
  - Seize control of railroads
  - Inequities and the “==20 Negro Law== ”: if someone eligible for the draft has 20+ slaves, they're exempt from the Draft
#### Northern economy
  - The North will win the war in large part because it is more fully industrialized than the South, but the Civil War will also push the North into a full industrial revolution
  - Treasury, new national banking system w/ national bank notes, greenbacks, income tax
  - Furthered agricultural revolution as machines replace missing workers
  - ==Quartermaster Dept== .: Montgomery Meigs. Ex: Jay Cooke & govt. bonds
    - Meigs invested a lot of money into the Union army, equipping soldiers lavishly
  - ==Transcontinental RR==  and govt. subsidies
    - U.S invested money into the railroad companies
  - ==Morrill Land Grant Act== : set aside federal lands for states to create colleges to “benefit the agricultural and mechanical art”
  - ==Homestead Act== : gave 160 acres of land to whoever would farm the land for 5 years and improve it ^17ae97
  - ==U.S. Sanitary Commission:==  Civilian organization in the North, staffed by large numbers of women, that was a major source of medical and nutritional aid for soldiers
- While Lincoln was running for president, he said he’ll do whatever it take to unite the union → ban slavery in the South
- As time went on, Lincoln became significantly more opposed to slavery
  - Against slavery but believes that blacks and whites shouldn't live together → colonization in Liberia
- ==First Confiscation Act:==  confiscated all property used for insurrectionary purposes; mandated that if the South used slaves in their war effort,
- ==Second Confiscation Act== : confiscated property of anyone who the war; freed all slaves held by the South
- Gradual emancipation w/ compensation for slave owners & colonization
- ==Radical Republicans:==   group of Republicans who assailed President Lincoln early in the war for failing to make emancipation a war goal and, later, for making it too easy for defeated rebel states to return to the Union ^768e47
#### Emancipation Proclamation
  - After the Battle of Antietam, Lincoln declares “all persons held as slaves in areas in rebellion shall be then, thenceforward and forever free
    - But … not the border states and not any country or city under Union control
  - Makes the Northern Army an army of liberation → whatever areas the Union controls, all slaves are forever free & abolishes slavery
  - Lincoln based this on his powers of Commander in Chief, so it could expire after his term → must amend the constitution!!
  - When Lincoln wins re-election in 1864 (largely b/c he lets soldiers vote), he forces Congress to create an amendment abolishing slavery → 13th Amendment
- Both Lincoln & the slaves themselves are accredited with freeing the slaves; **(1)** Lincoln: Emancipation proclamation & 13th Amendment, **(2)** slaves: if the slaves didn't free themselves throughout the south, the confiscation acts wouldn't've been necessary
# VI: Reconstruction
#### Presidential (Lincoln) v. congressional reconstruction
  1. ==Lincoln's 10% plan==  (presidential)  10% of a Southern state's population must pledge loyalty to the federal government. Louisiana, Tennessee & Arkansas join the Union w/ the 10% rule. Federal government & constitution, end slavery  
  2. ==Wade-Davis Bill==  (congressional): **(1)** majority of white male citizens must participate in creating a new government; **(2)** 50% of the population must sign an ironclad oath stating they never supported the confederacy; **(3)** high Confederate officials are stripped of citizenship → supported by [[#^768e47 |Radical Republicans]]
  3. Lincoln pocket vetoes the Wade-Davis Bill; he doesn't do anything about it, lets it expire
  4. ==Wade-Davis Manifesto==  (congressional): manifesto written by Radical Republicans urging voters to not vote for their candidate, Lincoln

- ==13th Amendment:==  Ratified in December 1865, it permanently abolished slavery in all U.S. territories → ratified BEFORE Lincoln's second term
  - The proposed amendment passed in early 1865 and was sent to the states for ratification. The war to save the Union had also become the war to free the slaves

- ==Freedman's Bureau:==  supplied food and medical services, built several thousand schools and some colleges, negotiated several hundred thousand employment contracts, tried to manage confiscated land
- Congress tells Southern states that **if they want help from the government, they must ratify the 13th amendment** (2/3 of congress votes the amendment out and 2/3 of the states must ratify)
- Lincoln is shot in April of 1865 & his VP, Andrew Johnson, takes power
- ==Sherman’s Special Field Order Number 15== : 400,000 acres in Sea Islands region… Johnson overturns it
  - Instead, sharecropping begins: tenants live on land that the landlord rents them, incl land, tools & feed, exchange for half of their crops
#### Presidential (Johnson) v. Congressional Reconstruction
  1. ==Johnson's reconstruction plan==  : completes all this while congress was adjourned
     - Barred federal officials, high-ranking Confederate officials, Confederate graduates of West Point, Ex-Confederates whose taxable property was >$20,000 (they had a choice to not be in the army but they joined anyway
     - Must ratify the 13th amendment & write a new Constitution, outlawing secession
     - Only those who took the ==Oath of Amnesty==  were eligible to vote on rejoining the Union
  2. Congress demands extension of Freedman's Bureau, passes ==Civil Rights Act of 1866==  → granted African Americans citizenship rights, including the right to own property and sue in court, thus protecting them from discrimination.
  3. Johnson vetoes the Civil Rights Act of 1866
  4. Congress overwrites the veto
  5. ==Black codes==  (presidential): used the slave codes as a basis to regulate the behavior of freedmen
  6. ==14th Amendment== (congressional): federal government protects rights and liberties of citizens from state tyranny → shift from idea of "federal tyranny" → "state tyranny"
  7. ==“Swing Around the Circle”==  (presidential): tried to get democrats in Congress to work on reconstruction but the Radical Republicans stayed in congress
  9. ==Continued Intransigence==  (presidential): Johnson continues to to obstruct the work of congress

#### Reconstruction Acts
  - ==First Reconstruction Act== : Union generals, commanding garrisons of troops and charged with supervising elections, assumed control in five military districts in the South. Confederate leaders were barred from voting until new constitutions were ratified.  
    - Guaranteed freedmen the right to vote in elections as well as serve in state constitutional conventions and in subsequent elections
  - ==The Second, Third, and Fourth Reconstruction Acts:==  provided the details of operation for voter registration boards, the adoption of constitutions, and the administration of “good faith” oaths on the part of white southerners
- After Johnson tried to remove Stanton ([[#^688b4e  |Tenure of Office]]), he was at last successfully impeached (on the third time) → remained in office w/ less than a year left in his term
- ==Fifteenth Amendment:==  Prohibited states from denying the vote to any citizen on account of “race, color or previous condition of servitude”
  - Final measure in the constitutional revolution of Reconstruction
#### U.S government policy
- ==Reservation policy:== US govt. forces multiple (possibly warring) tribes on the same reservations, then didn't respect the treaties . Is active until the 1880's until the govt. takes an assimilation stance
%%(continuation of policies that led to Indian Removal in the 1880s)%%
- Portion of former lands, with promised protection from white encroachment, and agreements to provide food, clothing and other necessities
- Movement into market economy increased many tribes' dependence on federal government subsidies
> [!info] Problems
> - Ward status (like children) - defined the Natives as helpless children under the protection of the U.S government
> 	- Denied U.S citizenship
> 	- No 14th/15th amendment protection
> 	- White settlers continued to encroach on Native lands no matter what the treaty agreement or reservation boundaries said; ignored Native history by putting warring tribes on the same land
>

![[Pasted image 20230124120336.png|500]]

#### Resistance & Indian Wars
- Navajo, "Long Walk" (1863-64, much like the [[S1 Wiki(APUSH.)#^5ae16c|trail of tears]])
- ==Sand Creek Massacre of Cheyenne band by Major John Chivington (1864):== a group of soldiers gets drunk then kill an entire tribe while they were PEACEFULLY transitioning to a new reservation (?) UNDER TREATY → goes to congress
- Pinnacle of resistance: ==Little Big Horn →== Lakota Cheyenne destroyed the U.S military and there were no white settlers left alive. Most successful Indian rebellion, marks the end of native resistance
- ==Ghost Dance==  reaction to U.S colonialism and entailing dancing for hours in order to communicate with elders & negotiate for a future that respected their belief. ==
- Ghost Dance begins a conflict b/c some natives tell whites that their dance outfits are bulletproof, initiating Wounded Knee==
- Reform
- ==Women's National Indian Association:== white women bring literacy, western civilization to native societies in attempts to bring reform. They find problem w/ Native society's work balance → women's role is more substantial in native society than separate sphere society   ^fe3a2e
- ==Indian Rights Association:== groups that believe Natives have a right to citizenship and landholding
- Emphasis on European sexual division of labor (native women lose traditional role)
#### Dawes Severalty Act
- Supported by the [[#^fe3a2e|Women's National Indian Association]]
- Ends reservation policy
- Logical extension of reform, seeks to assimilate Native Americans by emphasizing private land ownership and western family structures
- Family head of household receives 160 acres, each child under 18 gets 40 acres
	- Land held in trust for 45 years. Citizenship to Native Americans who take the allotment
- Unallocated lands could be sold to whites (SCAMMERS!)
- Case study of the Ojibwas: 138 million acres (1887) → 52 million (1930)
- ==Carlisle school: most infamous native assimilation school==
#### How the West was won (government/big business cooperation)
- Mining - Nevada, Montana, Utah, Colorado
- Miners prospected, but major corporations mined deposits using modern technologies
	- Example: Anaconda Copper Company (gold, copper, lead, zinc, tin, quartz)
- Lumber corporations - ==Timer and Stone Act:== land deemed unfit for cultivation was sold to settlers for logging + valuable metals
- Oil corporations
- Cattle ranching
- ==Central & Union Pacific:== massive land subsidies and other incentives (180 million acres) from federal, state, local govt.
#### Water
- ==Riparian Rights:== only those who owned land along a river bank could appropriate from the water's flow. The stream itself belonged to God, those who live near water can take from it but not diminish its flow; largely practiced in the East. "Common law" like [[S1 Wiki(APUSH.)#^c325c6|Coverture]]
- ==Prior Appropriation:== awarded a river's water to the first person who claimed it - water existed to serve human needs and advance profits (LMFAO WHAT).
- ==California Solution:== mixed legal system that allowed farmers to organize into districts to construct and operate irrigation projects that could purchase water rights, seize private property, and build irrigation canals → pay for it all via taxation or issuing bonds=
- ==Newlands Reclamation Act:== authorized the Secretary of the Interior to designate irrigation sites and to establish a reclamation fund from the sale of public lands to finance the projects (federal)
#### New states
- ==Omnibus Bill of 1889:== ND, SD, WA, MT
- 1890 - WY & ID (allowed women to vote!)
- 1896 - Utah (should've been earlier)
![[Pasted image 20230127121427.png|500]]

#### Farming the plains
- ==28 inch rainfall line:== West of this line agriculture is very difficult w/o modern irrigation==
![[Pasted image 20230130124213.png|500]]
- 1870s - 1880s: more acres put under cultivation in Kansas, Nebraska, and Texas than the entire nation in 250 years
- Insufficient lumber - sod houses, buffalo dung, and barbed wire
- Unpredictable weather - ==The Children's Blizzard== (1888)
- Social isolation b/c of the war Americans farm
- John Glidden created barbed wire → changed future of fences & property lines
- Mail order companies - Sears & rural free delivery
- Over-farming of the plains occurs thanks to [[S1 Wiki(APUSH.)#^17ae97|Homestead Act]] & other related acts
- Sears saved a lot of families during first year of homesteading. Amazon:Covid = Sears:Fronteir
- ==Morril Land Grant Acts (1862/1890):== set aside federal lands to create colleges to “benefit the agricultural and mechanical arts.”
- ==Hatch Act:== provided for necessary basic and applied agricultural research to be conducted by the state colleges of agriculture in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)==
- ==Dry Farming:== crop production without irrigation during a dry season==
- ==Russian wheat:== wheat that grows easily on the plains, brought from Russia==
- Luther Burbank & George Washington Carver were horticulturists who researched crops that grow easily on the plain - Carver created the peanut
- Vaqueros - Open-range ranching
- ==Fence Cutter wars:== series of disputes between cowboys w/ larger land holdings==
- 21 year era of the cowboy was put to an end by the use of barbed wire
#### "New" South?
- Henry Grady, editor, *Atlanta Constitution*
- Mixed industry and Commercial Agriculture - infrastructure to tie together the South & North. Not a total focus on industrialism in the South though ⇒ **doesn't work**
- Industry in the South: textile mills, cigarette (Duke buys patent for a cigarette rolling machine), lumber, iron/steel, Coca-Cola, coal mining - railroads
- Agriculture - share cropping, tenant farming, crop lien
	- $\frac{1}{3}$ of farmers were sharecroppers @ 1880
	- $\frac{2}{3}$ of farmers were sharecroppers @ 1920
- Closing the Southern range
- Continued racism limited economic advancement
%%Evaluate the extent to which the US expansion into the West had a lasting legacy on the nation and the region.%%
%%Evaluate the extent to which the homesteading act changed the economic, political, and social landscape of the US West.%%
#### Patricia Limerick, "The Legacy of Conquest"

- Thesis: racism complicated the west, foreshadowing the challenges the U.S will face with diversity in the 2nd century
- Social unrest is occurring @ the same time in China
	- Push: railroad
	- Pull: home
- *==People v. Hall:==*  involved an attempted murder charge against the defendant, Jonathan Hall. Hall was accused of shooting at two people, striking one in the arm. He was convicted and sentenced to fifteen years in prison. Whether Chinese can testify against whites, blanks, Indians ⇒ SC rules that "if Indians are banned, then Asians should be as well". Prohibits the testimony on the basis that the groups should have been put together (?)
- =="The Chinese Must Go" Movement:== w/ new wave of immigrants, Irish are now "apart" of U.S culture==
	- Led in San Francisco by Irish immigrant
- ==Chinese Exclusionary Laws (1882):== federal law stopping almost all immigration from China → US== ^600dcd
	- Expires in 20 years, continued until 1940
- ==Anti-Miscegenation Laws:== laws banning interracial sexual relations; passed primarily to prevent Chinese men from marrying white women==
#### Exodusters: African Americans in the West
- ==Exodusters:== African Americans who move to the west (post-Civil War) & even form their own all-black towns
	- Very few African Americans leave the South after the civil war ⇒ attempt to stay in place & rebuild family after  they're freed
- [[S1 Wiki(APUSH.)#^32abaf|Free soil]]
- ==Exclusion laws:== laws banning blacks from certain towns in the West
	- ==Sundown towns:== all-white municipalities that practice racial segregation by excluding non-whites via some combination of discriminatory local laws, intimidation or violence ⇒ **if any blacks are caught out & about after sundown, they're lynched** (?)
- 14th & 15th Amendments in CA and OR: both states finally ratify the 14th/15th Amendments
#### Mormons in the West
- [[S1 Wiki(APUSH.)#^e1bd7e|Second Great Awakening]], Joseph Smith, & the *Book of Mormon*
# VII: The Gilded Age
#### Key factors in the industrial revolution
- **Technology & innovation**: electric power, power generator, internal combustion
- **Mechanization, structure of work, economies of scale**: dis-assembly lines (meat packing led the day) → assembly lines via Henry Ford
- **Business structures/corporate organization**
	- ==Pool:== gentlemen's agreement in which business owners agree not to raise prices. Illegal now==
	- ==Trusts:== business owned by one person, but is broken up into stock & given to a board of trustees==
	- ==Cartel:== association of business owners who work together to coordinate prices/production
	- ==Incorporation:== a company recognized by law to exist independently from its owners, with the ability to own property, borrow money, sue or be sued. Encourages funding new business organization
- ==Consumer republic:== a new national culture
#### Democratization of convenience
- Edison - tungsten filament/incandescent light bulb. AC/DC and power generators, also phonograph and motion pictures
	- Didn't invent lightbulbs but was the first person to make it affordable  
- Henry Ford - democratized the automobile → moving assembly line $5/day ^e2d946
- Andrew Carnegie - Bessemer process and steel production
- DuPonts - gunpowder monopoly → diversified into fertilizer, dyes, cellulose, other chemical products
- Duke, Kellogg, Post
#### New corporate organization
- New technologies required large capital investments, investment banking entered a new age
- Holding companies are companies that get bought out, but the goods are still produced under the original company's name → example: Pepsi owning multiple different drink brands
- ==Horizontal integration:== owning all of one SPECIFIC part of production
- ==Vertical integration:== companies own every step in production. Ex: Ford owning coal mines, transportation from coal → plant, etc
#### Dissent? To capitalism?
- ==Social Darwinism== - Herbert Spencer: the people that have wealth b/c they're better ⇒ trusts shouldn't be destroyed. Wealth flows to those most capable of handling it  
	- Edward Bellamy rejects this notion in *Looking Backward*, stating the **government owns the means of production**. Sets up an alternate economic world where capitalism is restrained. Everyone works according to their abilities
- ==Sherman Antitrust Act== (1890): Prohibits "every contract, combination, or conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states." Makes it illegal for individuals or companies to "monopolize"  ^1a2e5c
- ==*U.S v. E.C Knight Co*== (1895): sugar trust owned 98% of sugar-refining but court ruled that control of manufacturing doesn't equal control of trade ⇒ discarded much of the Sherman Antitrust Act
#### Changing nature and status of labor
- ==Scientific Management/Fredrick Taylor== ("Taylorism"): scientific organization of production by subdividing tasks to increase efficiency ⇒ make jobs increasingly skill-less
- Workers increasingly powerless, become the interchangeable parts themselves
	- Ex: McCormick Reapers - had been hand made by skilled machinists and woodworkers. Introduced mechanization and machine patterns to allow precise duplication of interchangeable parts.  <font style="color:green">1880: 21,000 reapers</font> → <font style="color:blue">1885: 100,000 reapers</font>
- ==Pink collar jobs==
	- Woman and children drive down labor costs ⇒ child labor laws very ineffective
	- "Women's work": clerical/secretarial and sales (typists, filing clerks, billing clerks, store clerks), "Hello Girls" (telephone operators), manufacturing (factory job) and domestic service → [[Civil War & Reconstruction#^ac837e|Government girls]]
#### Freedom of contract & the S.C
- ==Freedom of Contract:== **labor is property, I have a property right to my labor**, I can sell it without the oversight of the state (w/in the law). Market conditions of supply and demand fix wages at a living rate, beyond that, I have the right to alienate my property any way I see fit ⇒ **PROBLEM**: causes oversupply of workers!! Freedom of contract is used to strike down laws like minimum wage, max working hours,… The market will regulate itself
	- Henry Ford argues against this and creates the [[#^e2d946|$5 day]]: if your labor force can't purchase the good you're producing, you're losing. ALTERNATE: can decrease required workforce
- ==*Holden v. Hardy*== (1891): state creates a law stating minors can't work in a mine for > 10 hours in a day to cut accident rate down. Supreme court agrees w/ the state this time **ONLY B/C** of the danger associated w/ mining
- ==*Lochner v. New York*== (1905): S.C rules that NY can't create a law that limits the max # of working hours for bakers (it isn't dangerous enough). Industry:
- ==*Muller v. Oregon*== (1908): S.C upholds a law limiting the workday for women to 10 hours. One of the first cases in which the S.C recognized the importance of protecting the rights of workers. Industry: laundry
	- ==Brandeis Brief:== argument that women need to be protected so they can produce offspring
#### Labor Unions & Strikes

^56d826
- ==Knights of Labor:== organization that tried to organize a broad base of laborers (un/skilled) and eventually had a membership of 730,000, including blacks, whites, women, the Chinese, and more
- ==American Federation of Labor:== alliance of craft unions, led by Samuel Gompers, that accepted capitalism and worked to improve conditions from within, unlike the Knights of Labor, who had more radical beliefs ^fe0c73
- ==Industrial Workers of the World:== organization that attmepted to unite unskilled workers by embracing violent tatctics and the rhetoric of class conflict & socialism
- ==International Ladies Garment Workers Union== (ILGWU): organization of mostly Jewish immigrant shirtwaist workers that is responsible for the infamous "uprising of 20,000"
- ==Women's Trade Union League== (WTUL): female-only labor organization seeking shorter working hours, better conditions, and supported strikes, that transitioned from a focus on middle class → working class women
#### Strikes
- ==Railroad Strikes== (1877): series of striking, provoked by wage cuts, layoffs, and increase in workloads, that involved workers attacking railroad property from PA to TX, ending in daily clashes between strikers & troops
- ==Railroad Strike in the SW== (1886): when railroad company owner Jay Gould refused to negotiate the end of a strike, some Knights of Labor resorted to violence before giving into Gould's asks
- ==Haymarket Riot:== protestors gathered in Haymarket Square to protest police brutality, resulting in police showing up, who arrest several activists after a bomb was detonated (anarchists)
- ==Homestead Strike:== the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers launched this strike against Homestead Steal, who hired guards to protect the factory, resulting in violence between the guards & workers
- ==Pullman Strike:== workers @ Pullman Palace Company walked out (due to the owner's refusal to negotiate wage cuts), and refused to handle any Pullman car attached to a train  ^a0a675
#### "New Immigrants"
- Older patterns of immigration supplanted after 1880
- **Push factors**
	- Social unrest b/c Tsars are losing power → creating power vacuum
	- Russia finally ends feudalism
	- Italy in transition (?) phase
	- Russia's pogroms
	- Germany trying to unify ->waves of political unrest causing Germans to leave
- **Pull factors**
	- Relative religious freedom
	- Industrialization
	- [[Civil War & Reconstruction#^0b9b31|Homestead Act]] (esp. attract Germans b/c its similar to farming back home)
	- ==Serial immigration== - immigrants move via word of mouth
- Italians overwhelmingly work for a few years to make money, then return home
- **Challenges**
	- Catholic/Jewism/Eastern Orthodox
	- Unfamiliar languages
	- Low-skill occupations
	- Not used to democracy
![[Pasted image 20230209114933.png|500]]
- ==Ethnic enclaves/urban borderlands (ghettos):== areas in which one specific ethnic group has settled → greater cultural retention, less assimilation
- **Continued racism**
	- [[The West#^600dcd|Chinese Exclusion Act]]
	- ==Geary Act:== forced Chinese Americans to carry a piece of paper to confirm their citizenship
#### New problems / new solutions
- American urban centers develop differently than Europe - property on edge of city is most expensive in USA **V.S** property right in the middle of the city is the most expensive in Europe
- Technology saves the day → furnaces, electric lighting, indoor plumbing
- [Jacob Riis - *How the Other Half Lives*:](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fmymodernmet.com%2Fjacob-riis-how-the-other-half-lives%2F&psig=AOvVaw1A682NifKXC4GEWwMTEFk0&ust=1676048631707000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CA8QjRxqFwoTCIi3_Oz1iP0CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAX) exposed the difficult life of a first-generation immigrants & wealth inequality
- ==Political Machines:== organizations used to influence and control the political process via fraud. Found in large cities, farmed votes by helping immigrants with finding jobs,.. Even though they succeeded via illegal means, they are well-supported b/c they support the immigrants when no one else will
- ==City Beautiful Movement:== group of women that try and fix up cities to make them pretty
- ==Settlement House Movement:==  Group of women who tour Europe after school and create an organized effort to provide social services, education, and other assistance to the urban poor. Supported struggling immigrants, women by holding cooking classes, daycare centers, etc. [Jane Addams/Florence Kelley](https://study.com/academy/lesson/florence-kelley-jane-addams-on-child-labor.html#:~:text=Jane%20Addams%20and%20Florence%20Kelley%20were%20women%20from%20similar%20backgrounds,means%20of%20accomplishing%20these%20goals.)
#### Gilded Age Politics
- ==Gilded age:== term coined by Mark Twain, the U.S as a nation is shiny is golden and shiny on the outside, but there is a corrupt core of decadence and even decay
- Massie voter turnout: 80% of electorate participated in elections (1870 - 1896)
- Major issues of the day: railroad regulation, Civil War pensions for Northern veterans, patronage/spoils system, tariffs and currency (gold vs. silver standard)
- Major disagreements on how best to deal w/ these issues
#### Democrats v. Republicans
[[S1 Wiki(APUSH.)#^49bf0a|Democrats v. Whigs]] ←
- [[S1 Wiki(APUSH.)#^c03e4a|Republicans]]: wide spectrum in the Republican party. Divisions among the Stalwarts & Half Breeds, both working the spoils system for their own benefit. Also the Mugwumps (Republicans who wanted more reform of things like civil service). The Republican faction is a **coalition** rather than a party
	- Regional differences: Northern Republicans want the gold standard, western Republicans want silver standard
	- In general, they believed the govt. should be an agency of reform
- [[S1 Wiki(APUSH.)#^f6cdb9|Democrats]]: Northern interested in urban and economic issues, still have support of immigrants. Southern Democrats looks to defend white supremacy (still). In general, believe that governments shouldn't interfere in issues of personal liberty
	- Against regressive taxes (support income tax) → a tax that takes a larger percentage of income from low-income groups than from high-income groups **V.** supportive of progressive taxes → taxes that fuck with the rich more than the poor  ^561c6f
	- Against tariffs all together
	- Silver standard
		 ![[Party systems.canvas]]
#### Police powers & opposition
- ==Policing powers:== State police powers have nothing to do w/ state police! A state has the legislative power to protect the general welfare of the population through regulation and enforcement of order. Nanny state? → building codes, quarantine laws, pure food and drug acts, control of patent medicines,..
- State laws can enforce laws on business owners to help the workers
- BUT, under the 14th amendment, businesses have the right to use their private property as they see fit. Business regulation cannot deny business profit w/o due process - according to the S.C :(
#### Railroads/pensions/civil service/tariffs/money supply
- Railroad regulation?
	- ==*Munn v. Illinois*:== yes, grain warehouses operate in the public interest and can be regulated
	- ==Wabash Cases:== railroad operations between several states is interstate & cannot be regulated by a single state → Interstate Commerce Act (Commission)
	- ==Maximum Freight Rate Case==: limits based on the 14th amendment rights of railroads →  govt. cannot set rate. "The invisible hand of the market will figure it out"
- Pensions: no one wants to vote against pensions… but they are a huge govt. expenditure (40% of federal annual budget by 1900)
- ==Civil Service Reform==: despite advantage to political parties and machines, after President Garfield's assassination, there's huge support for the ==Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act== → provided that federal government jobs be awarded on the basis of merit and that government employees be selected through competitive exams, made it unlawful to fire or demote for political reasons employees who were covered by the law. **Move away from the spoils system**
#### Tariffs/Gold v. Silver Monetary Policy
- Republican view (especially in the north): high tariffs are good → ex: McKinley tariff, Wilson-Gorman tariff, Dingley Tariff. But, government produces a surplus = bad. Republicans want the Democrats to reduce tariffs b/c **the government is not a 'for profit' institution**
- Silver v. gold: more money in economy, should be good for farmers and working class, allow farmers to secure bank loans → lets go for silver. This would create inflation, but they want it b/c they want their crop price to go up (debt is @ fixed interest rate). Businessmen: rest of the world is on the gold standard, we should be too b/c it'd make trade easier. SILVER PUTS MORE $ $ $ IN THE ECONOMY ^77af92
- ==Bimetallism:== idea of using gold AND silver
#### Gilded Age Presidents
- Rutherford Hayes
- James Garfield
- Chester Arthur
- Grover Cleveland
	- Illegitimate son
	- Kind of gross
	- Raises tariffs
	- Vetoed pension bills
- Benjamin Harrison
	- Cold
	- No one liked him
- Grover Cleveland

[[February WIKI TERMS]]
# VIII: The Progressive Era
#### What is progressivism?
- Reaction to the excesses of the Gilded Age
- "The era between 1895 and 1920 [which] included a series of movements, each aiming in one way or another to renovate or restore American society, values, and institutions with a hope that a better future lay ahead" → rejection of the "dog eat dog" attitude of the gilded age
#### Problems
- Industrial capitalism has led to overproduction, domineering monopolies, labor strife, and destruction of natural resources
- Cities breed poverty, crime, and disease
- Social order reconfigured with waves of immigrants AND creation of new managerial and professional classes
#### Solutions
- End abuse of power
- Protect the welfare of all people
- Reform institutions and promote social efficiency
#### Changing electorate
- 1896 election is pinnacle of popular participation
- Drop in the north from 80% → 60%, drop below 30% in the South
- @ the same time, there's a rise in national associations with political influence: ABA, NAWSA, NCL… etc
- New tools to help w/ democratic reform: (1) ==initiate== → propose new laws; (2) ==referendum== → voters can accept/reject a law; (3) ==recall== → remove elected officials from office
#### Muckrakers & middle class reform
- ==Muckraker:== term coined by T.R used as an insult to journalists identified with pre-WWI reform and exposé literature
	- Sought to reveal and reform the evils of the day. Wrote in magazines, newspapers, books, etc.
- [[The Gilded Age#^0fe5b4|Settlement House Movement]]
#### Social Gospel
- "The ==social gospel seeks== to bring men under repentance for their **collective** sins and to create a more sensitive and more modern conscience. It calls on us for the faith of the old prophet who believed in the **salvation of nations**"
- While Charles Sheldon asked "WWJD?", others like Walter Rauschenbusch wanted to create a kingdom of God on earth
#### Working class reform
- Especially effective in NYC thanks to the Triangle Shirtwaist factory fire
- ==Bread and butter reform:== safe factories/factory inspection, shorter workdays, worker compensation, protection of women & children laborers, better housing, better taxation ^630e49
- Progressives seek minimum age for employment, but ==common education laws== were more effective → spread of access to educational services
#### Socialism
- The struggle between the ==bourgeoise==, the middle-class who owns the means of production, and the proletariats, who labor for the wealth accumulation of others (bourgeoise)
- To fix this, the means of production, and the government (or workers collective) can ensure that all men and women receive fair pay for a fair day's work
- Not as problematic in the gilded age, there was no tension that was caused by the Cold War
- ==Eugene Debs:== head of the American Railway Union who was imprisoned for his role in the [[March MCQ WIKI#^a0a675|Pullman Strike]], and after reading Karl Marx in jail, and ran for president as the socialist candidate 5 times (never won)
- Most Americans see socialism as incompatible with capitalism → "American Dream"

|<u>Northern Securities Company</u>: huge railway company that was Roosevelt's first broken trust. Was sympathetic to cooperation between govt. & business as he urged the Bureau of Corporations to aid companies in merging & expanding. Administration cajoled businesses to self-regulate, and they often cooperated b/c it helped them operate more efficiently & reduce overproduction |<u>Payne-Aldrich Tariff</u>: Payne bill was originally passed in the house to lower tariffs (very very high), but Senator Aldrich (fighting Bob) restored most of the cuts made by the tariff. Taft ended up passing the tariff, causing a schism in the Republican party: progressives & conservatives. |<u>New Freedom</u>: counter to Roosevelt's "New Nationalism" that revolved around the idea that concentrated economic power threatened individual liberty & that monopolies could be broken up so that the marketplace could be genuinely open. Didn't restore laissez-faire, however.                                                                                                   |
|<u>Hepburn Act</u>: strengthened the [[The Gilded Age#^dbdd35\|Interstate Commerce Commission]] to inspect railroad financials and set "just and reasonable rates". Also required shippers to prove they weren't violating the law                                                                                                                                                           |<u>Mann-Elkins Act</u>: bolstered the regulatory powers of the I.C.C and supported labor reforms such as shorter work hours & mine safety legislation.                                                                                                                                                   |<u>Clayton Anti Trust Act</u>: corrected deficiencies of the [[The Gilded Age#^1a2e5c\|Sherman Anti Trust Act]] by outlawing practices like price discrimination (lowering prices in some regions, but not others) and interlocking directorates (management of 2+ competing companies by the same executives). Also aided labor by exempting unions from its anti-combination provision |
|<u>Meat Inspection/Pure Food and Drug Act</u>: prohibited dangerously altered food and required that labels list all the ingredients of a product. Govt. had to finance inspections; meatpackers could appeal a decision                                                                                                                                                                     | ==16th Amendment==: legalized the federal income tax as a permanent source of federal income                                                                                                                                                                                                      |<u>Federal Trade Commission</u>: investigated companies and could issue cease & desists for unfair legal practices.

|<u>Square Deal/Anthracite Coal Strike</u>: mine owners refuse to arbitrate strikers' demands of 8hr work day and higher pay, so Roosevelt threatened military action (for the first time against owners), forcing the owners to give in; didn't require recognition of union → cooperation                                                                                                   | ==17th Amendment==: provided for the direct election of senators                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | ==Federal Reserve Act==: established the nation's first national banking system since 1836.

|<u>Conservationism</u>: Roosevelt first protected natl. wonders like the Olympic Peninsula & Grand Canyon, then expanded conservation w/ the creation of 5 natl. parks + 53 bird conservatories                                                                                                                                                                                              |<u>Taft broke 2x as many trusts in half the time as TR</u> but lacked the ability to rouse the public w/ spirited rhetoric.

#### Government and legislative reform
- **Weakening the political machines**
	- City managers (hired as experts rather than elected positions), who work as urban planners, and commissioners  
	- ==17th Amendment:== allowed for the direct election of
- **Prohibition**
	- ==Women's Christian Temperance Union== (WCTU): religious organization whose primary purpose was to combat the influence of alcohol on families and society → large supporters of the
	- ==Dry  communities==: regions where alcohol is banned
- **Prostitution** - ==White Slavery:== anti-prostitution movement sparked by rumors that women were sold into sex trade through prostitution
	- ==White Slave Traffic Act (Mann Act)== (1910): criminalized the transportation "of any woman or girl for the purpose of prostitution or debauchery, or for any other immoral purpose"
- [[The Gilded Age#^915cd1|Brandeis Brief]]
#### Progressive challenges to racial discrimination
- Booker T. Washington believed the way to deal w/ the ongoing assault was to (somewhat) accommodate (==accommodationist==)to the white beliefs to ensure black safety. Argued that African Americans must concentrate on educating themselves in learning useful trades and investing in their own businesses. Hard work would prove the value of blacks to the American economy ^e691bf
	- Atlanta Compromise - [[The Atlanta Exposition Address|"Cast Down Your Bucket"]]
- ==Anti-Bookerites== - "Niagara Movement" and the creation of the NAACP. Economic rights must be coupled with full civil and political rights. Strongly disagreed w/ Washington. Led by DuBois → believed blacks needed full civil and political rights, no accommodation
	- "The way for a people to gain their reasonable rights is to not by voluntarily throwing them away" - DuBois  ^a7d075
#### "Social Housekeeping" / Birth Control / Suffrage and Feminism
- Utilitarian argument ([[The Gilded Age#^dd299f|Maternalism]]), argues for rights based on women's special, even superior traits as guardians of the family. Women's morality would humanize society
- Jane Addams on ==Civic Housekeeping==: called on women – especially middle class women w/ leisure and energy, as well as rich philanthropists – to exercise their civic duty to become involved in municipal affairs  ^85eaf2
- Feminists make a rights based argument → women as **women** – not soldier, not housekeepers –  deserve equal rights because they are American citizens. Emphasis on economic and sexual independence; unpaid female labor is common despite the fact that they make an important economic impact
	- Margret Sanger's *Women and Economics* argue that industrial labor wouldn't be possible w/o women. Also advocates for the distribution of sex and contraception, pushed for the legalization of birth control
- ==National Women's Party==, Harriet Stanton Blatch, Alice Paul: imprisoned for chaining themselves to the gates of the White House, resulting in going on a hunger strike, which creates a large PR problem → leads to Wilson being forced to pass the 19th Amendment
- ==19th Amendment==: gives women the legal right to vote ^c9260a
# IX: Imperialism
#### Anti-Imperialists
- Mark Twain, William Jennings Bryan, William Graham Sumner, Jane Addams, Andrew Carnegie, Samuel Gompers (leader of [[March MCQ WIKI#^fe0c73|AFL]])
	- Conquest of people against their will violates US principles of self-determination (DEMOCRACY) - US "puking up its heritage"
	- American character being corrupted by militarism inherent in imperialism
	- Double standard, democracy abroad, [[The Gilded Age#^74a875|Chinese exclusion act]], Jim Crow laws, [[The West#^10886a|Native forced assimilation at home]]
- ==US - Philippine War== (1899 - 1902): US use of concentration camps, attacks on women & children led to large loss of life for Filipinos. Finally gained full independence in 1946
#### Foreign policy elite
- Dominated by the ==Foreign policy elite==: Henry Adams (historian, JQA's grandson), John Hay (credited w/ Open Door policy), TDR, Henry Cabot Lodge (senator), Elihu Root (Secretary of war and SOS)
- Why? Profits.   Foreign markets also a "safety valve" and assist w/ overproduction, unemployment due to underconsumption, economic depression from cyclical economy, and social tensions resulting from all of the above
- Also, surge in nationalism,  belief in [[The Gilded Age#^3aef5f|Social Darwinism]] comingled w/ paternalism and racism (US as Anglo-Americans should be a civilizing force on the world), and American exceptionalism, worries about the "closing of the frontier"
	- Josiah Strong, *Our Country*, updates exceptionalism for a new day
#### Expansion
- William Seward (Secretary of State during Lincoln's presidency, 1861 - 1869): wants a US empire in the Western Hemisphere stretching across the Pacific ocean ^1dfd25
	- Tries to annex Virgin Islands
	- Purchases Alaska - ==Seward's Icebox== - $7.2bn
	- Claimed Midway
	- Eyeballing Hawaii
- Alfred T. Mahan, *The Influence of Sea Power Upon History*: states the US needs foreign markets, and must have coaling statins and naval bases to reach the foreign markets, must have a larger protective navy, must have a professional class of foreign service works   ^d3ee72
- TDR built the ==Great White Fleet== → naval fleet that the US toured around the world ^4eb2b2
#### Hawaii
- 1890 - Americans in Hawaii owned $\frac{3}{4}$ of Hawaii's wealth despite being only 2.1% of the population. Hawaiian sugar exports entered the US duty free
	- They had forced the king to accept a constitution that allowed foreigners the right to vote and shifted power to the legislature
	- 1890 - ==McKinley Tariff== eliminated the duty-free status of Hawaiian sugar
	- American elite on island pushed for annexation
	- New queen, Lili'ukoalani, wanted to regain power from American elite
	- 1893: Queen Lili'uoaklani arrested, forced to cede power - gives it to US govt. instead of Annexation club
	- Cleveland suspicious and everything on hold until SPAM
![Atlas Map: The American Empire, c. 1900|500](https://wps.pearsoncustom.com/wps/media/objects/5407/5537171/atlas/Resources/sm_ah4_m006.jpg)
#### Cuba
- More than 9% of Cuban sugar was exported to the US duty free until the 1894 ==Wilson-Gorman Tariff== → lose their duty free status. US investments in Cuba totaled more than $50 million
- ==Cuba Libre==: Spanish General Valeriano Weyler created "reconcentration camps " ^925573
- Amid continuing unrest, US sends the USS Maine
	- It blows up in the Havana Harbor → U.S knows it wasn't Spain but they're blamed anyways
- ==Teller Amendment==:  that once Cuba was freed from Spanish control, the United States would not seek to exercise permanent control over the island → US wouldn't annex! ^c31250
- USA has a military base called "Gitmo" where they hold captives - don't need to comply to US constitutional jail rights
#### POW! BAM! SPAM!!!
- ==Spanish American Cuban Filipino Guamian War==
	- As much about acquiring Spain's island empire as it was about Cuban independence
	- Motives: humanitarian impulse ([[#^925573|thanks to depiction of reconcentration camps in yellow newspapers]]), concern for commerce and American property in Cuba, and desire to monopolize markets in Cuba, fulfill expansionist dreams
- General Dewey strikes first… in Manila?
- War was over by August (begun in late April)
- ==Treaty of Paris==: Cuba is independent, under protection of the US, who gains Philippines, Puerto Rico, Guam. Philippines and Guam act as important coaling and naval stations on the way to the "open door" in China, Puerto Rico protects a canal zone
#### Open door policy
^808489
- Fall of the Qing Dynasty, rise of JP, led to carving up of China → "spheres of influence"
- US entered the scene late
- John Hay, SOS and member of foreign policy elite, created the ==Open Door policy== asking European powers to respect the principles of free trade
	- Europe says "Oh Hecky Nah" …until the US assists in the Boxer Rebellion
- Pattern: US will intervene to protect economic interests and free trade (over and over) → domestic wellbeing requires exports, so the US must intervene to protect foreign trade & keep markets open, any closing of an area to American products is seen as threatening the survival of the US itself.
	- US has done this multiple times and will continue to do so: China, Cuba, Philippines,..
#### TR's World
- [[Progressive Era#^d1f355|Theodore Roosevelt:]] progressive & imperialist president → assistant secretary of the Navy, Rough Riders, VP, President, Bull Moose
	- "Speak softly, carry a big stick, and you will go far "
- Emphasis on 2 strategic areas
	1. Development of US navy (big supporter of [[#^d3ee72|The Influence of Sea Power Upon History]])
	2. Importance of Latin America and reaffirmation of an American sphere of influence
- During his presidency, US built 11 battleships - and sent "Great White Fleet" on a world tour from 1907 - 1909
- ==Gunboat diplomacy==: sending naval forces and the marines into a national capital to temporarily seize control of the govt, protecting American and Western personnel and dictating policies friendly to American business  ^4be795
#### Roosevelt corollary
- ==Platt Amendment==: Cuba can't make treaties that impair their independence (US must approve Cuban foreign treaties), US has the right to intervene to secure Cuban independence, Cuba has to lease Guantanamo Bay to US as a military base
![[S1 Wiki(APUSH.)#^f4180d]] ^ff6210
- ==Roosevelt Corollary==: US wanted to support stable, prosperous states in Latin America that live up to their political and financial obligations… And create or enforce that stability when it didn't exist. US found that govt. mismanagement, civil wars, military coups, turnover in regimes created insecure environments for US business, and invited European intervention **therefore, the US will engage in preemptive attack and intervene in any Latin American nation whose behavior puts it in danger of defaulting on loans or "inviting" European intervention** → intervenes to ensure favorable political/economic govt. for their workers  ^6f23bc
#### US intervention in Mexico
1. Revolution in 1910 overthrows President Porfirio Diaz
2. Destabilizes country and panics American capitalists who have investments there
3. US refuses to recognize Victoriano Huerta, who had executed democratically elected Francisco Madero
4. US invaded port city of Veracruz to stop it from receiving shipment of arms for Huerta's government ⇒ Huerta overthrown. US supports Venustiano Carranza, but, Pancho Villa engages in raids on the US border
	1. General John J. Pershing can't seem to catch him or stop the raids on US soil
- **Recurring pattern: US willing to intervene militarily in Latin American affairs to protect US economic interests in the region**
#### Dollar diplomacy

^2117c6

- US govt encouraged private bankers to provide loans to China and Latin American nations to modernize and bring these countries into American sphere of influence. But, this gave the US more control over their national fiscal affairs. Taft and Wilson also used it
- ==Panama Canal==: US needs a way to move merchant goods & troops w/o going around South America (England backs out of partnership), then incite revolutionaries in Panama to revolt against Colombian control in return for fiscal control/canal
- ==Hay Pauncefote Treaty==: provided for unrestricted submarine cable construction and operation by either country in any part of the world. Also gave the United States exclusive rights to build and control a canal across Central America for any purpose it chose.
#### Japan
- US/Japan on collision course as both follow imperialist policies in Asia
- [[#^4eb2b2|Great White Fleet]] led Japan to increase their naval fleet as well
- ==Taft-Katsura Agreement==: conceded Japanese hegemony over Korea in return for Japan's pledge not to undermine the U.S position in the Philippines
- ==Root-Takahira Agreement==: US recognized Japan's interests in Manchuria,…
# XI: WWI (1914 - 1920)
#### Entangling Alliances
- ==Triple Alliance==: Germany, Austria-Hungary, Italy (original German alliance)
- ==Triple Entente==: UK, RU, FR
- The beginning of World War I was sparked by the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary on June 28, 1914, in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. This event was the catalyst for Austria-Hungary to declare war on Serbia. In response, Russia began to mobilize its troops and Germany declared war on Russia and France shortly after. Great Britain then declared war on Germany, thus beginning World War I.
	- Austria-Hungary declares war on Serbia b/c of the assassination, and Russia declares war on Austria-Hungary to protect Slavic allies, and the rest of the triple entente joins
#### Neutrality in hearts and minds, but not in business
- Ethnic tensions within the U.S b/c of immigration
- But, worries that if Germany won, and therefore dominated Europe, their militarism would be bad for US business there and in European colonies around the world
- 1914 - 1916, US exports to UK & FR increase 365%
- Exports to Germany (largely due to English blockade) drop by 90%, from $345 million to $29 million
- Loans: private American banks loaned $2.3 billion to Britain and France, $27 million to Germany … lopsided neutrality
- Wilson has bad civil liberties record:, puts limits on free speech & press. Didn't allow any dissent, incl. socialist dissent
#### Violation of neutral rights?
- Britain, "ruling the waves and waiving the rules"
- Germany responded w/ Unterseebooten (U-Boats) and unrestricted submarined warfare
- **Lusitania (May 7, 1915)**
	- Germany agrees to use restricted submarined warfare after the sinking of the Lusitania, but returns to it in **February 1917**
	- Germany WARNED the U.S that no citizens should board the Lusitania in a newspaper, but U.S still gets pissy when Americans in the Lusitania die (idiots)
	- ==Zimmerman Telegram==: secret diplomatic communication sent by the German Empire's Foreign Secretary Arthur Zimmermann to Mexico in January 1917. It proposed an alliance between Germany and Mexico in the event that the United States entered World War I on the side of the Allies. The telegram was intercepted and decoded by British intelligence and its contents leaked to the press in the US, helping to sway public opinion in favor of US involvement in WWI
- US moved to armed neutrality, declared war on April 2, 1917
- ==Selective Service Act==: required all males between the ages of 21-30 to register for WWI.
#### Wilsonianism
- **Will be the basis of 14 points, but notice the emphasis on American Exceptionalism** ^77600f
	1. Open diplomacy without secret treaties  
	2. Economic free trade on the seas during war and peace  
	3. Equal trade conditions  
	4. Decrease armaments among all nations  
	5. Adjust colonial claims  
	6. Evacuation of all Central Powers from Russia and allow it to define its own independence  
	7. Belgium to be evacuated and restored  
	8. Return of Alsace-Lorraine region and all French territories  
	9. Readjust Italian borders  
	10. Austria-Hungary to be provided an opportunity for self-determination  
	11. Redraw the borders of the Balkan region creating Roumania, Serbia and Montenegro  
	12. Creation of a Turkish state with guaranteed free trade in the Dardanelles  
	13. Creation of an independent Polish state  
	14. Creation of the league of nations
- President Wilson’s insistence on the inclusion of the League of Nations in the Treaty of Versailles (the settlement with Germany) forced him to compromise with Allied leaders on the other points. Japan, for example, was granted authority over former German territory in China, and self-determination—an idea seized upon by those living under imperial rule throughout Asia and Africa—was only applied to Europe. Following the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, Wilson returned to the United States and presented it to the Senate.
#### Bolshevik Revolution and the 14 points
- November 1917: Lenin's Bolshevik forces succeeded in overthrowing Aleksander Kerensky's liberal-democratic government
	- Lenin's government published Alllied secret agreements, including those dividing up the colonies and territories of the Central Powers
- Wilson responded w/ the 14 points → a reiteration of Wilsonianism and US war aims ^79d8a3
	- Diplomacy in the public view
	- Freedom of seas
	- Lower tariffs
	- Arms reduction
	- Decolonization of empires
	- Evacuation of foreign troops from Russia, Belgium, FR
	- Self-determination of nationalities in Europe, create a League of Nations

- ==War Industries Board==: coordinated military purchasing and ensured production efficiency along w/ supplying the military. Among other things, it made purchases, allocated supplies, fixed prices, standardized goods
#### Civil Liberties
- ==Committee on public information:==  The Committee on Public Information (CPI) was a U.S. government agency created in 1917 to coordinate and promote public support for U.S. involvement in World War I. The CPI was headed by journalist George Creel, who had been appointed by President Woodrow Wilson to lead the organization. The committee employed a wide range of tactics to promote its messages, including press releases, posters, pamphlets, and motion pictures. It also sponsored speaking tours of prominent Americans such as famous aviator Eddie Rickenbacker and Hollywood actor Charlie Chaplin in order to bolster public enthusiasm for the war effort. The CPI's work was so successful that it continued operating until the end of the war in 1918. Although it is remembered as an example of wartime propaganda, the CPI also helped introduce modern advertising techniques and public relations strategies that are still used today.
- ==Four-minute men:== in charge of "four minute updates" to spread the news of how the war is going to the public. Emphasis on =="dropping the hyphen"== → meaning that you are just American, rather than a German-American or an Irish-American
	- =="100% Americanism":== similar to dropping the hyphen; if you're American, you're only American
- ==Espionage act:== the first statute forbade "false statements" designed to impede the draft or promote military subordination. Banned from mails materials considered treasonous
- ==Sedition Act:== unlawful to obstruct the sale of war bonds and to use "disloyal, profane, scurrilous, or abusive" language to describe the government, the Constitution, the flag, or the military uniform
# XII: Post-war America
#### Economic Expansion & a consumer society
- ==Corporate consolidation==: growth of monopolies
- Agriculture is in serious trouble
- Tariffs keep going up ⇒ ==Fordney-McCucumber Tariff==: imposed high protective tariffs on imported goods. Helped create a boom in the American economy in the 1920s as it allowed American business to thrive w/o fear of competition from foreign source
- Govt. "regulation" [[#^fd11f4|FTC and ICC]] move to a cooperative, non-regulated relationship w/ businesses
#### Labor pendulum
- Gilded age = Freedom of Contract, [[Progressive Era]] ⇒ Square Deal
==Coronado Coal Company v. United Mine Workers==:  S.C concluded that a striking union could be prosecuted for illegal restraint of trade
- ==Maple Floor Association v. US==: court decided that trade associations that distributed anti-union info were not acting in restraint of trade (DOUBLE STANDARD?)
- ==Bailey v. Drexel Furniture==: child labor laws should be state-enforced, rather than federally
- ==Adkins v. Children's Hospital==: S.C struck down a D.C minimum wage law b/c it violated the "freedom contract" right within
- ==Yellow dog contracts==: contracts that state if an employee is hired, they cannot join a union
- ==Welfare capitalism==: improve conditions so that there's no need for Unions (employed by Ford )
- ==Governor Coolidge + Massachusetts police strike==:  In response to the Massachusetts police strike of 1919, Governor Calvin Coolidge firmly asserted that “there is no right to strike against the public safety by anybody, anywhere, anytime.”
#### Foreign policy in the [[Interwar Period]]
- Characterized by a U.S "return" to isolationism ([[S1 Wiki(APUSH.)#^f4180d|Monroe Doctrine]])
- ==Treaty of Versailles==: peace conference to outline the conditions of peace between Germany and its allies
![[#^79d8a3]]
- ==League of Nations==: Wilson's primary goal for the conference, create an international alliance between allied countries, with **collective defense**
		- ==Article 10==: section of the League of Nations defining collective defense
	- ==Separate peace==: agreement to cease military hostilities with another even though the former country had previously entered into a military alliance with other states that remain at war with the latter country
	- **Outcomes:** **(1)** Germany surrenders all colonies in Africa, Asia, Pacific, reduces military, must pay reparations; **(2)** created the independent states of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Austria, Hungary, and more
	- Congress refused to ratify the Treaty of Versailles b/c they disagreed with the League of Nations, primarily Article 10 b/c it eliminated the country's policy of nonalignment
- ==Washington Naval Conference==: called by Harding to maintain peace and disarmament between US, JP, IT, BE, PT, FR, NE
	- ==5 Power Treaty==: signed in 1922 by the United States, Great Britain, Japan, France, and Italy, which limited the naval arms race among these countries in the aftermath of World War I. Banned construction of battleships for 10 years.
	- ==9 Power Treaty==: marked the internationalization of the [[March MCQ WIKI#^808489|Open Door Policy]] & recognized China's sovereignty

#### Reactions to the forces of modernity
- **KKK returns**
	- Natives, white, protestant supremacy
	- Anti-immigrant, white supremacist, anti-Catholic, anti-Jewish
	- Use sales tactics to appeal to a wider audience, causing the base of the KKK to be spread further than just the south
- Nicolas Sacco & Bartolomeo Vanzetti: two anarchist Italian immigrants who were wrongfully imprisoned for murder (put to death?). Used as fuel for the anti-immigration cause
- ==Emergency Quote Act (1921)==: restricted the number of immigrants admitted from any country to 3% of the number of residents from that country living in the US. All Asians were banned from immigrating to the US (for 10 years?)
- ==National Origins Act (1924)==: limited the number of immigrants that could be admitted to the U.S to 2% of the 1819 census ^e37623
- ==Fundamentalism==: wave of people returning to evangelical & traditional beliefs. **Interpret the bible as LITERALLY**, very anti-evolution
- ==Scopes Trial==: defendant was a teacher who taught evolution where it was illegal (TN), was done purposefully in order to gain attention from the press, and highlight the illogical reasoning of fundamentalists
Calvin Coolidge (V.P for Harding) takes over (who SUCKED) when Harding dies, and he believed in a small government. It should act as a partner with business
#### Election of 1928
|                  | Hoover          | Smith                      |

#### Causes of the Great Depression
1. Speculation
2. Foreign debt triangle ⇒ **if one of these pieces fail, the economy goes down with it**
	- U.S is losing money giving money to Germany to prevent revolution
	- Germany uses this money to pay reparations
	- European countries are using these reparations to pay America back
3. Stock market crash is a RESULT of the Great Depression
4. Corporate debt
5. **Declining demand and underconsumption**
6. Buying stocks on margin
7. Corporate debt
8. ==Johnson Act (1934)==: U.S congress declares that if any European country defaults on a loan to the US, they'll never get another loan again

#### Herbert Hoover (BAD)
- Opens the door to the government taking a more active stance in helping the economy when it's in trouble
- ==Associationism==: government and business should work together to set higher minimum wages, industry hours, etc.
- ==President's Organization for Unemployment Relief== (POUR): private philanthropy group led by corporate leaders providing money to the poor.
- "It's not the function of the government to relieve individuals of their responsibilities to their neighbors. Ask the people in your community" ⇒ **not the business of the government to provide handouts**

- ==Hawley-Smoot Tariff==: raised tariffs on some goods up to 40%
- ==Reconstruction Finance Corporation==: agency created to loan money to assist ailing banks, railroads, and other institutions. However it failed b/c its actions were on too small a scale to have any effect
- Built up the federal reserve
#### Public loses faith
- ==Bonus Army==: group of veterans want their money early and begin a march with their families on Washington until they reach their destination and set up "Hoovervilles" ⇒ Hoover calls in several military regiments.
- ==Franklin Delano Roosevelt==: supports direct relief payments for the unemployed, wants a "new deal"
	- Runs as a Democrat b/c the Republicans FUCKED UP the 1920s ⇒ **causes a party switch: Democrats are now the party of federal aid**
- ==Banking Holiday==: closes every bank in the country for four days, checks bank records, and the only banks that reopen are the ones that have the support
- ==Emergency Banking Relief Act==: allows the twelve Federal Reserve Banks to issue additional currency on good assets and thus the banks that reopen will be able to meet every legitimate call
	- Creates the ==FDIC=== to support the "common man's investment"P
- FDR uses the radio to communicate with citizens directly, proving that they're in a ==crisis of confidence==

| The 3 R's | 1st Hundred Days                                                                             | 2nd New Deal |

#### The New Deal and …
- **Opposition**
	- Al Smith, ==American Liberty League==: economic conservatives in Democratic Party who thought the government aid was too much
	- Father Charles Coughlin, Dr. Francis Townshend, ==Old Age insurance==: $200 a month paid for w/ transition tax
	- Huey Long, ==Share Our Wealth Society==: $200 for every American every year, few thousand to every American for housing a few times in their life
	- U.S communist party: increased in popularity as some believed the government aid that had been given to them wasn't enough
- The first ever "==sit down strike==" occurred @ GM/Ford factories in Flint, in which workers entered the factory and refused to move, despite the risk of being penalized or fined. After 45 days the plants agreed to recognize their Union, primarily b/c Michigan's governor refused to send in the national guard

$^{1:}$ The Wagner Act's purpose was to strengthen Section 7a of the NIRA, which allowed for the creation of unions. The NIRA had been declared unconstitutional, except for section Section 7a, but the provision was too weak to stand on its own. Businesses found loopholes to circumvent it, thus the need for the Wagner Act
#### How to LEQ
##### Intro
- **Context**
	- 2-3 sentences
	- Can't include info that belongs in the body of the essay
	- "Take a full step back"
- **Thesis**
	- Formula:  "Although *x*, *y* because *a* and *b*"
	- Question will ask you to "evaluate the extent of which"
##### Body 1 - argue for the "although x" part of the thesis
##### Body 2 - argue the "y because a and b" part of the thesis
- ***Note:*** only 2 bodies are required, but you can use three
##### Conclusion - restate thesis
#### Limits of the New Deal
- ==New Deal Coalition==: Urban working class (especially immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe), organized labor, 11 states that had formed the Confederacy (Solid South), Northern blacks t
- Parties realigned in 1932 because of FDR's leadership and his response to the Great Depression
- ==Court Packing Plan==
	- FDR tries to appoint up to 6 new justices so that his Social Security Act isn't declared unconstitutional, and congress dislikes this, so they drop support for his legislation, essentially ending the New Deal
- FDR tries to cut back on government spending, causing a recession to occur during the middle of the depression, called the Roosevelt depression ⇒ Depression + Recession (unemployment) = BAD
- The New Deal coalition was a political alliance formed in the United States during the Great Depression, which brought together various groups, including urban workers, ethnic minorities, farmers, and southern Democrats. The coalition supported President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal programs aimed at stimulating economic recovery and providing social welfare benefits. It helped to reshape American politics by creating a new base of support for the Democratic Party that would last for several decades.
- Roosevelt is able to still appoint 7 (maybe 4?) justices because many of them retire

		- LOOPHOLE: US is able to lease or "give away" money/arms to friendly countries
- US response to Jewish refugees? Poor at best… US maintained immigrant restrictions under the [[#^e37623|National Origins Act]] ⇒ refugees come to the US after almost being killed, and they refuse to let him in
#### Origins of the War in Europe
- Fascism and the rise of Hitler
	-  ==Kristallnacht== - Crystal Night: destruction of Jewish owned businesses, before Germany bans Jews the right to own businesses and beginning hella discrimination
	- Italy sacrifices their rights to get unity and order
	- ==Anschluss== (AS) - DE annexes Austria
	- Western countries respond with appeasement @ the ==Munich Accords== to prevent another war from happening. Lets DE them have Czechoslovakia and Austria, but the "Line in the Sand" is drawn @ Poland (protection of League of Nations). DE invades it anyway
	- ==Blitzkrieg==: lightning war ⇒ DE taking much of Europe very quickly
	- ==Sitzkrieg==: sitting war ⇒ DE invading Poland, then just chilling for a bit
