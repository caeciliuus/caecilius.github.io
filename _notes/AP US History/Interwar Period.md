# Interwar Period
### Economic expansion & a consumer society
- Return to the gilded age? → progressive age saw much reform for the working class & employers, while the post-war period is characterized by government-business cooperation (like [[The Gilded Age]])
- **Economic expansion**
	- Electric motors/new electric appliances
	- GNP (gross national product) grew 40% between 1919 and 1929
	- $\frac{2}{3}$ of Americans had electricity (1929), $\frac{1}{4}$ owned vacuum cleaners, $\frac{1}{5}$ owned a car
- ==Corporate consolidation==: growth of monopolies
- Agriculture is in trouble (meaning the natl. economy will be damaged soon)
- International position - U.S is a creditor nation, produced $\frac{1}{2}$ of the world's industrial goods, 1st among exporters
- [[March MCQ WIKI#^2117c6|Dollar diplomacy]] still active n Latin America
- Tariffs going up
	- ==Fordney-McCumber Tariff==: imposed high protective tariffs on imported goods . Helped to create a boom in the American economy in the 1920s, as it allowed American businesses to thrive without fear of competition from foreign sources.
- Govt. "regulation" [[March MCQ WIKI#^d1f355|FTC and ICC]] move to a cooperative, non-regulated relationship w/ businesses
### Labor pendulum
- Gilded age = freedom of contract, progressive era = square deal
- ==Coronado Coal Company v. United Mine Workers==:  S.C concluded that a striking union could be prosecuted for illegal restraint of trade
- ==Maple Floor Association v. US==: court decided that trade associations that distributed anti-union info were not acting in restraint of trade (DOUBLE STANDARD?)
- ==Bailey v. Drexel Furniture==: child labor laws should be state-enforced, rather than federally
- ==Adkins v. Children's Hospital==: S.C struck down a D.C minimum wage law b/c it violated the "freedom contract" right within
- ==Yellow dog contracts==: contracts that state if an employee is hired, they cannot join a union
- ==Welfare capitalism==: improve conditions so that there's no need for Unions (employed by Ford )
- ==Governor Coolidge + Massachusetts police strike==:  In response to the Massachusetts police strike of 1919, Governor Calvin Coolidge firmly asserted that “there is no right to strike against the public safety by anybody, anywhere, anytime.”
### Women
- **Genealogy**
	- [[S1 Wiki(APUSH.)#^78166f|Daughters of Liberty]] became Republican Mothers
	- [[S1 Wiki(APUSH.)#^d5cffa|Separate Spheres Ideology]] emphasized women's moral roles in home and society
	- Civil War/Industrial Revolution widen women's horizons
	- [[March MCQ WIKI#^51aab9|Civic housekeeping]]/The Woman Movement & Women's Clubs/[[Progressive Era#^22f74a|feminism]]/[[March MCQ WIKI#^a178dc|suffrage]]/[[March MCQ WIKI#^c9260a|19th Amendment]]
- Will there be a "women's vote"? No - most women (even today) vote the same as their upbringing/husband
	- ==League of Women's Voters==: created to educate women on different candidates that represented their needs & urge them to vote for these candidates
	- ==Sheppard-Towner Act==: provided federal funding for maternal and child health care. Also provided grants to states for the establishment of prenatal and child health clinics ⇒ slow down the rising infant mortality rate
	- ==Cable Act of 1923==: allowed women who married non-citizens to retain their US citizenship, instead of automatically losing it
- Declining birthrates, longer life expectancies, labor saving devices and higher standards of cleanliness
- Women in the workforce (women wages rarely exceeded $\frac{1}{2}$ of that paid to men)
- Flappers! Transition from dating → courting, long dresses → short
### Native Americans
- **Genealogy**
	- Indian removal (Cherokee + Trail of Tears, [[The West#^aa5732|Navajo and Long Walk)]]
	- [[The West#^4b64b0|Reservation policy]] and Indian Wars (like Wounded Knee & Little Big Horn)
	- [[The West#^80df3a|Dawes Act]] & assimilation
- New day, old idea - assimilation
- ==Snyder Act/Indian Citizenship Act==: granted citizenship only to those natives who lived on reservations (1924)
### Foreign policy in the Interwar Policy
- Characterized by a US "return" to isolationism ([[S1 Wiki(APUSH.)#^f4180d|Monroe Doctrine]])
- ==Treaty of Versailles==: peace conference to outline the conditions of peace between Germany & allies
	![[American Imperialism#^79d8a3]]
	- ==League of Nations==: Wilson's primary goal for the conference, create an international alliance between allied countries, with **collective defense**
		- ==Article 10==: section of the League of Nations defining collective defense
	- ==Separate peace==: agreement to cease military hostilities with another even though the former country had previously entered into a military alliance with other states that remain at war with the latter country
	- **Outcomes:** **(1)** Germany surrenders all colonies in Africa, Asia, Pacific, reduces military, must pay reparations; **(2)** created the independent states of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Austria, Hungary, and more
	- Congress refused to ratify the Treaty of Versailles b/c they disagreed with the League of Nations, primarily Article 10 b/c it eliminated the country's policy of nonalignment
- ==Washington Naval Conference==: called by Harding to maintain peace and disarmament between US, JP, IT, BE, PT, FR, NE
	- ==5 Power Treaty==: signed in 1922 by the United States, Great Britain, Japan, France, and Italy, which limited the naval arms race among these countries in the aftermath of World War I. Banned construction of battleships for 10 years.
	- ==9 Power Treaty==: marked the internationalization of the [[March MCQ WIKI#^808489|Open Door Policy]] & recognized China's sovereignty
	- ==4 Power Treaty==: US, JP, GB, FR agreeing to respect each other's pacific holdings
- ==Locarno Pact of 1925==:  DE, FR, BE, IT, GB mutually guaranteed peace in western Europe
- ==Kellogg Briand Pact of 1928==: agreement between US, FR, GB renouncing the use of war as a means of settling international disputes, declared that war is no longer a legitimate tool of national policy
### African Americans
- **Genealogy**
	- Bound labor: from indentured servants to African slavery
	- 13th, 14th, 15th Amendments
	- Reconstruction
	- U.S v. Cruikshank, U.S v. Reese, Plessy v. Ferguson, Cumming v. County Board

- ==Great migration==: the boll weevil destroyed crops throughout the South, leading sharecroppers to leave the land, primarily to migrate to the North (and some to the West)
	- ==Marcus Garvey==: believes there should be a separation between whites & blacks. Whites fucked up society, and they aren't worthy of collaboration
		- Government sees him as very radical & eventually has him killed
		- Created multiple different businesses supported by blacks, took them on cruises, etc.
- ==Harlem Renaissance==: culture of blacks living in Harlem creating their own culture, independent from white influence. Lots of poetry, creative writing
	- Jazz: created in St. Louis, a product of independent black culture in America
- KKK is back?
### Reactions to the forces of modernity
- **New KKK**
	- Natives, white, protestant supremacy
	- Anti-immigrant, white supremacist, anti-Catholic, anti-Jewish
	- Use sales tactics to appeal to a wider audience, causing the base of the KKK to be spread further than just the south
- Nicolas Sacco & Bartolomeo Vanzetti: two anarchist Italian immigrants who were wrongfully imprisoned for murder (put to death?). Used as fuel for the anti-immigration cause
- ==Emergency Quote Act (1921)==: restricted the number of immigrants admitted from any country to 3% of the number of residents from that country living in the US. All Asians were banned from immigrating to the US (for 10 years?)
- ==National Origins Act (1924)==: limited the number of immigrants that could be admitted to the U.S to 2% of the 1819 census
- ==Fundamentalism==: wave of people returning to evangelical & traditional beliefs. **Interpret the bible as LITERALLY**, very anti-evolution
- ==Scopes Trial==: defendant was a teacher who taught evolution where it was illegal (TN), was done purposefully in order to gain attention from the press, and highlight the illogical reasoning of fundamentalists
	- Trial makes Bryant (and fundamentalism) look stupid as fuck, people turn against fundamentalism
### Election of 1928
- Calvin Coolidge (V.P for Harding) takes over (who SUCKED) when Harding dies, and he believed in a small government. It should act as a partner with business

|                  | Hoover          | Smith                      |
| ---------------- | --------------- | -------------------------- |
| Political stance | Conservative    | Progressive                |
| Legislation      | Tariff increase | Restriction of immigration |
| Public image     | Unpopular       | Popular                    |
| Prohibition?     | Prohibition     | Anti-prohibition           |
| Religion         | Quaker          | Catholic                            |
### Causes of the Great Depression
- Speculation
- Foreign debt triangle ⇒ **if one of these pieces fail, the economy goes down with it**
	- U.S is losing money giving money to Germany to prevent revolution
	- Germany uses this money to pay reparations
	- European countries are using these reparations to pay America back
- Stock market crash is a RESULT of the Great Depression
- Corporate debt
- **Declining demand and underconsumption**
- Buying stocks on margin
- Corporate debt
- ==Johnson Act (1934)==: U.S congress declares that if any European country defaults on a loan to the US, they'll never get another loan again
- Lack of federal regulation
### Herbert Hoover (BAD)
- Opens the door to the government taking a more active stance in helping the economy when it's in trouble
- ==Associationism==: government and business should work together to set higher minimum wages, industry hours, etc.
- ==President's Organization for Unemployment Relief== (POUR): private philanthropy group led by corporate leaders providing money to the poor.
- "It's not the function of the government to relieve individuals of their responsibilities to their neighbors. Ask the people in your community" ⇒ **not the business of the government to provide handouts**
- Eventually creates small public works projects funded by the federal government, setting people back to work; however, they were too small
- ==Hawley-Smoot Tariff==: raised tariffs on some goods up to 40%
- ==Reconstruction Finance Corporation==:
- Built up the federal reserve
### Public loses faith
- ==Bonus Army==: group of veterans want their money early and begin a march with their families on Washington until they reach their destination and set up "Hoovervilles" ⇒ Hoover calls in several military regiments.
- ==Franklin Delano Roosevelt==: supports direct relief payments for the unemployed, wants a "new deal"
	- Runs as a Democrat b/c the Republicans FUCKED UP the 1920s ⇒ **causes a party switch: Democrats are now the party of federal aid**
- ==Banking Holiday==: closes every bank in the country for four days, checks bank records, and the only banks that reopen are the ones that have the support
- ==Emergency Banking Relief Act==: allows the twelve Federal Reserve Banks to issue additional currency on good assets and thus the banks that reopen will be able to meet every legitimate call
	- Creates the ==FDIC=== to support the "common man's investment"
- FDR uses the radio to communicate with citizens directly, proving that they're in a ==crisis of confidence==
