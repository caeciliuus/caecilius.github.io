## Origins of the US-Soviet Conflict
- Different solutions to postwar problems
- Decolonization and new Third World Allies hiiii!!!!
- Sought influence in JP and DE
- Political turmoil in other nations led to USSR-US competition

## Different Solutions and Models to Postwar Problems
### USSR 
-  Seeking ultimate victory over capitalist countries 
-  Preventing another invasion of their homeland (less secure than the U.S.) 
	-  Siberia (vital for minerals) thousand miles away from Moscow (China, Japan encroachment)  
	-  Poland border violent clashes since WWI 
	-  Eastern Europe Hitler’s invasion  
-  Maritime access chief goal (large landmass but short seacoast, most iced) 
-  Limited aims for territorial expansion  
	-  Only wanted to include the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania,  
	-  Eastern prewar Poland (fearful of revived Germany) 
	-  Northern Iran (Turks, naval bases, free access to the Black Sea) 
-  Economic Independence rather than world trade  
	-  Refused to join the new World Bank and IMF (Capitalist tool of exploitation?)  
- Joseph Stalin  
	- Ruthless periodic purges  
	- Suspicious of capitalist powers (paranoid and Xenophobia!) 
	- Marxist-Leninist (“them” vs. “us”) 
### USA
- Strongest power in the world
	- Fixed capital intact
	- Fewer casualites
	- Sole possession of the atomic bomb
		- Truman refused to turn it over to intl. control
- Sought quick reconstruction of nations (DE and JP)
- Forward bases (deter Soviet expansion in Europe + Asia)
- Free trade
- Harry Truman
	- Also "them" vs "us"
	- Simple answer in either/or (nuances, ambiguities, counterevidence → no lol)
	- "Tough method" (cold war diplomacy) → little diplomacy
## Decolonization and the New Third World
- Why decolonization?
	- Financial constraints
	- Nationalist rebellions
- Result of decolonization
	- Creation of the "New Third World"
	- Increased Soviet-American competition (military bases, markets, resources)

	- Failed to solve a balance-of-payment problem and divided Europe
- ==National Security Act of 1947==: mandated a major reorganizatoin of the foreign policy and military establishments of the US government.
