# American Imperialism
#### Foreign policy elite
- Dominated by the ==Foreign policy elite==: Henry Adams (historian, JQA's grandson), John Hay (credited w/ Open Door policy), TDR, Henry Cabot Lodge (senator), Elihu Root (Secretary of war and SOS)
- Why? Profits. If the US is going to grow economically, it has to support US industries and agriculture by exporting surplus. Foreign markets also a "safety valve" and assist w/ overproduction, unemployment due to underconsumption, economic depression from cyclical economy, and social tensions resulting from all of the above
- Also, surge in nationalism,  belief in [[The Gilded Age#^3aef5f|Social Darwinism]] comingled w/ paternalism and racism (US as Anglo-Americans should be a civilizing force on the world), and American exceptionalism, worries about the "closing of the frontier"
	- Josiah Strong, *Our Country*, updates exceptionalism for a new day
#### Expansion
- William Seward (Secretary of State during Lincoln's presidency, 1861 - 1869): wants a US empire in the Western Hemisphere stretching across the Pacific ocean
	- Tries to annex Virgin Islands
	- Purchases Alaska - ==Seward's Icebox== - $7.2bn
	- Claimed Midway
	- Eyeballing Hawaii
- Alfred T. Mahan, *The Influence of Sea Power Upon History*: states the US needs foreign markets, and must have coaling statins and naval bases to reach the foreign markets, must have a larger protective navy, must have a professional class of foreign service works   ^d3ee72
- TDR built the ==Great White Fleet== → naval fleet that the US toured around the world ^4eb2b2
#### Hawaii
- 1890 - Americans in Hawaii owned $\frac{3}{4}$ of Hawaii's wealth despite being only 2.1% of the population. Hawaiian sugar exports entered the US duty free
	- They had forced the king to accept a constitution that allowed foreigners the right to vote and shifted power to the legislature
	- 1890 - ==McKinley Tariff== eliminated the duty-free status of Hawaiian sugar
	- American elite on island pushed for annexation
	- New queen, Lili'ukoalani, wanted to regain power from American elite
	- 1893: Queen Lili'uoaklani arrested, forced to cede power - gives it to US govt. instead of Annexation club
	- Cleveland suspicious and everything on hold until SPAM

#### Cuba
- More than 9% of Cuban sugar was exported to the US duty free until the 1894 ==Wilson-Gorman Tariff== → lose their duty free status. US investments in Cuba totaled more than $50 million
- ==Cuba Libre==: Spanish General Valeriano Weyler created "reconcentration camps " ^925573
- Amid continuing unrest, US sends the USS Maine
	- It blows up in the Havana Harbor → U.S knows it wasn't Spain but they're blamed anyways
- ==Teller Amendment==:  that once Cuba was freed from Spanish control, the United States would not seek to exercise permanent control over the island → US wouldn't annex!
- USA has a military base called "Gitmo" where they hold captives - don't need to comply to US constitutional jail rights
### POW! BAM! SPAM!!!
- ==Spanish American Cuban Filipino Guamian War==
	- As much about acquiring Spain's island empire as it was about Cuban independence
	- Motives: humanitarian impulse ([[#^925573|thanks to depiction of reconcentration camps in yellow newspapers]]), concern for commerce and American property in Cuba, and desire to monopolize markets in Cuba, fulfill expansionist dreams
- General Dewey strikes first… in Manila?
- War was over by August (begun in late April)
- ==Treaty of Paris==: Cuba is independent, under protection of the US, who gains Philippines, Puerto Rico, Guam. Philippines and Guam act as important coaling and naval stations on the way to the "open door" in China, Puerto Rico protects a canal zone
#### Open door policy

^574fbf

- Fall of the Qing Dynasty, rise of JP, led to carving up of China → "spheres of influence"
- US entered the scene late
- John Hay, SOS and member of foreign policy elite, created the ==Open Door policy== asking European powers to respect the principles of free trade
	- Europe says "Oh Hecky Nah" …until the US assists in the Boxer Rebellion
- Pattern: US will intervene to protect economic interests and free trade (over and over) → domestic wellbeing requires exports, so the US must intervene to protect foreign trade & keep markets open, any closing of an area to American products is seen as threatening the survival of the US itself.
	- US has done this multiple times and will continue to do so: China, Cuba, Philippines,..
#### TR's World
- [[Progressive Era#^d1f355|Theodore Roosevelt:]] progressive & imperialist president → assistant secretary of the Navy, Rough Riders, VP, President, Bull Moose
	- "Speak softly, carry a big stick, and you will go far "
- Emphasis on 2 strategic areas
	1. Development of US navy (big supporter of [[#^d3ee72|The Influence of Sea Power Upon History]])
	2. Importance of Latin America and reaffirmation of an American sphere of influence
- During his presidency, US built 11 battleships - and sent "Great White Fleet" on a world tour from 1907 - 1909
- ==Gunboat diplomacy==: sending naval forces and the marines into a national capital to temporarily seize control of the govt, protecting American and Western personnel and dictating policies friendly to American business
#### Roosevelt corollary
- ==Platt Amendment==: Cuba can't make treaties that impair their independence (US must approve Cuban foreign treaties), US has the right to intervene to secure Cuban independence, Cuba has to lease Guantanamo Bay to US as a military base
![[S1 Wiki(APUSH.)#^f4180d]]
- ==Roosevelt Corollary==: US wanted to support stable, prosperous states in Latin America that live up to their political and financial obligations… And create or enforce that stability when it didn't exist. US found that govt. mismanagement, civil wars, military coups, turnover in regimes created insecure environments for US business, and invited European intervention **therefore, the US will engage in preemptive attack and intervene in any Latin American nation whose behavior puts it in danger of defaulting on loans or "inviting" European intervention** → intervenes to ensure favorable political/economic govt. for their workers
#### US intervention in Mexico
1. Revolution in 1910 overthrows President Porfirio Diaz
2. Destabilizes country and panics American capitalists who have investments there
3. US refuses to recognize Victoriano Huerta, who had executed democratically elected Francisco Madero
4. US invaded port city of Veracruz to stop it from receiving shipment of arms for Huerta's government ⇒ Huerta overthrown. US supports Venustiano Carranza, but, Pancho Villa engages in raids on the US border
	1. General John J. Pershing can't seem to catch him or stop the raids on US soil
- **Recurring pattern: US willing to intervene militarily in Latin American affairs to protect US economic interests in the region**
#### Dollar diplomacy
- US govt encouraged private bankers to provide loans to China and Latin American nations to modernize and bring these countries into American sphere of influence. But, this gave the US more control over their national fiscal affairs. Taft and Wilson also used it
- ==Panama Canal==: US needs a way to move merchant goods & troops w/o going around South America (England backs out of partnership), then incite revolutionaries in Panama to revolt against Colombian control in return for fiscal control/canal
- ==Hay Pauncefote Treaty==: provided for unrestricted submarine cable construction and operation by either country in any part of the world. Also gave the United States exclusive rights to build and control a canal across Central America for any purpose it chose.
#### Japan
- US/Japan on collision course as both follow imperialist policies in Asia
- [[#^4eb2b2|Great White Fleet]] led Japan to increase their naval fleet as well
- ==Taft-Katsura Agreement==: conceded Japanese hegemony over Korea in return for Japan's pledge not to undermine the U.S position in the Philippines
- ==Root-Takahira Agreement==: US recognized Japan's interests in Manchuria,…
- U.S intervention into Russo-Japanese War (1904 - 1905), offer to mediate the crisis → once again adds onto U.S-Japanese tension that culminates until Pearl Harbor
#### WWI: Entangling Alliances
- ==Triple Alliance==: Germany, Austria-Hungary, Italy (original German alliance)
- ==Triple Entente==: UK, RU, FR
- The beginning of World War I was sparked by the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary on June 28, 1914, in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. This event was the catalyst for Austria-Hungary to declare war on Serbia. In response, Russia began to mobilize its troops and Germany declared war on Russia and France shortly after. Great Britain then declared war on Germany, thus beginning World War I.
	- Austria-Hungary declares war on Serbia b/c of the assassination, and Russia declares war on Austria-Hungary to protect Slavic allies, and the rest of the triple entente joins
#### Neutrality in hearts and minds, but not in business
- Ethnic tensions within the U.S b/c of immigration
- But, worries that if Germany won, and therefore dominated Europe, their militarism would be bad for US business there and in European colonies around the world
- 1914 - 1916, US exports to UK & FR increase 365%
- Exports to Germany (largely due to English blockade) drop by 90%, from $345 million to $29 million
- Loans: private American banks loaned $2.3 billion to Britain and France, $27 million to Germany … lopsided neutrality
- Wilson has bad civil liberties record:, puts limits on free speech & press. Didn't allow any dissent, incl. socialist dissent
#### Violation of neutral rights?
- Britain, "ruling the waves and waiving the rules"
- Germany responded w/ Unterseebooten (U-Boats) and unrestricted submarined warfare
- **Lusitania (May 7, 1915)**
	- Germany agrees to use restricted submarined warfare after the sinking of the Lusitania, but returns to it in **February 1917**
	- Germany WARNED the U.S that no citizens should board the Lusitania in a newspaper, but U.S still gets pissy when Americans in the Lusitania die (idiots)
	- ==Zimmerman Telegram==: secret diplomatic communication sent by the German Empire's Foreign Secretary Arthur Zimmermann to Mexico in January 1917. It proposed an alliance between Germany and Mexico in the event that the United States entered World War I on the side of the Allies. The telegram was intercepted and decoded by British intelligence and its contents leaked to the press in the US, helping to sway public opinion in favor of US involvement in WWI
- US moved to armed neutrality, declared war on April 2, 1917
#### Wilsonianism
- **Will be the basis of 14 points, but notice the emphasis on American Exceptionalism**
	1. Open diplomacy without secret treaties  
	2. Economic free trade on the seas during war and peace  
	3. Equal trade conditions  
	4. Decrease armaments among all nations  
	5. Adjust colonial claims  
	6. Evacuation of all Central Powers from Russia and allow it to define its own independence  
	7. Belgium to be evacuated and restored  
	8. Return of Alsace-Lorraine region and all French territories  
	9. Readjust Italian borders  
	10. Austria-Hungary to be provided an opportunity for self-determination  
	11. Redraw the borders of the Balkan region creating Roumania, Serbia and Montenegro  
	12. Creation of a Turkish state with guaranteed free trade in the Dardanelles  
	13. Creation of an independent Polish state  
	14. Creation of the league of nations
- President Wilson’s insistence on the inclusion of the League of Nations in the Treaty of Versailles (the settlement with Germany) forced him to compromise with Allied leaders on the other points. Japan, for example, was granted authority over former German territory in China, and self-determination—an idea seized upon by those living under imperial rule throughout Asia and Africa—was only applied to Europe. Following the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, Wilson returned to the United States and presented it to the Senate.
#### Bolshevik Revolution and the 14 points
- November 1917: Lenin's Bolshevik forces succeeded in overthrowing Aleksander Kerensky's liberal-democratic government
	- Lenin's government published Alllied secret agreements, including those dividing up the colonies and territories of the Central Powers
- Wilson responded w/ the 14 points → a reiteration of Wilsonianism and US war aims ^79d8a3
	- Diplomacy in the public view
	- Freedom of seas
	- Lower tariffs
	- Arms reduction
	- Decolonization of empires
	- Evacuation of foreign troops from Russia, Belgium, FR
	- Self-determination of nationalities in Europe, create a League of Nations
- ==Treaty of Brest-Litovsk== (1918): Russia loses Poland, Finland, Baltic States, and Ukraine becomes independent
#### Mobilizing the home front
- ==National Act of 1916==: increases army and natl. guard
- ==Navy Act of 1916==: begins expansion of navy
- The draft allows the government to move certain people where they're supposed to be
- ==War Industries Board==: coordinated military purchasing and ensured production efficiency along w/ supplying the military. Among other things, it made purchases, allocated supplies, fixed prices, standardized goods
#### Civil Liberties
- ==Committee on public information:==  The Committee on Public Information (CPI) was a U.S. government agency created in 1917 to coordinate and promote public support for U.S. involvement in World War I. The CPI was headed by journalist George Creel, who had been appointed by President Woodrow Wilson to lead the organization. The committee employed a wide range of tactics to promote its messages, including press releases, posters, pamphlets, and motion pictures. It also sponsored speaking tours of prominent Americans such as famous aviator Eddie Rickenbacker and Hollywood actor Charlie Chaplin in order to bolster public enthusiasm for the war effort. The CPI's work was so successful that it continued operating until the end of the war in 1918. Although it is remembered as an example of wartime propaganda, the CPI also helped introduce modern advertising techniques and public relations strategies that are still used today.
- ==Four-minute men:== in charge of "four minute updates" to spread the news of how the war is going to the public. Emphasis on =="dropping the hyphen"== → meaning that you are just American, rather than a German-American or an Irish-American
	- =="100% Americanism":== similar to dropping the hyphen; if you're American, you're only American
- ==Espionage act:== the first statute forbade "false statements" designed to impede the draft or promote military subordination. Banned from mails materials considered treasonous
- ==Sedition Act:== unlawful to obstruct the sale of war bonds and to use "disloyal, profane, scurrilous, or abusive" language to describe the government, the Constitution, the flag, or the military uniform
