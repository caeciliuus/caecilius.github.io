title: Progressive Era
---
# Progressive Era
#### What is progressivism?
- Reaction to the excesses of the Gilded Age
- "The era between 1895 and 1920 [which] included a series of movements, each aiming in one way or another to renovate or restore American society, values, and institutions with a hope that a better future lay ahead" → rejection of the "dog eat dog" attitude of the gilded age
##### Problems
- Industrial capitalism has led to overproduction, domineering monopolies, labor strife, and destruction of natural resources
- Cities breed poverty, crime, and disease
- Social order reconfigured with waves of immigrants AND creation of new managerial and professional classes
##### Solutions
- End abuse of power
- Protect the welfare of all people
- Reform institutions and promote social efficiency
#### Changing electorate
- 1896 election is pinnacle of popular participation
- Drop in the north from 80% → 60%, drop below 30% in the South
- @ the same time, there's a rise in national associations with political influence: ABA, NAWSA, NCL… etc
- New tools to help w/ democratic reform: (1) ==initiate== → propose new laws; (2) ==referendum== → voters can accept/reject a law; (3) ==recall== → remove elected officials from office
#### Muckrakers & middle class reform
- ==Muckraker:== term coined by T.R used as an insult to journalists identified with pre-WWI reform and exposé literature
	- Sought to reveal and reform the evils of the day. Wrote in magazines, newspapers, books, etc.
- [[The Gilded Age#^0fe5b4|Settlement House Movement]]
#### Social Gospel
- "The ==social gospel seeks== to bring men under repentance for their **collective** sins and to create a more sensitive and more modern conscience. It calls on us for the faith of the old prophet who believed in the **salvation of nations**"
- While Charles Sheldon asked "WWJD?", others like Walter Rauschenbusch wanted to create a kingdom of God on earth
#### Working class reform
- Especially effective in NYC thanks to the Triangle Shirtwaist factory fire
- ==Bread and butter reform:== safe factories/factory inspection, shorter workdays, worker compensation, protection of women & children laborers, better housing, better taxation
- Progressives seek minimum age for employment, but ==common education laws== were more effective → spread of access to educational services
#### Socialism
- The struggle between the ==bourgeoise==, the middle-class who owns the means of production, and the proletariats, who labor for the wealth accumulation of others (bourgeoise)
- To fix this, the means of production, and the government (or workers collective) can ensure that all men and women receive fair pay for a fair day's work
- Not as problematic in the gilded age, there was no tension that was caused by the Cold War
- ==Eugene Debs:== head of the American Railway Union who was imprisoned for his role in the [[March MCQ WIKI#^a0a675|Pullman Strike]], and after reading Karl Marx in jail, and ran for president as the socialist candidate 5 times (never won)
- Most Americans see socialism as incompatible with capitalism → "American Dream"

|<u>Northern Securities Company</u>: huge railway company that was Roosevelt's first broken trust. Was sympathetic to cooperation between govt. & business as he urged the Bureau of Corporations to aid companies in merging & expanding. Administration cajoled businesses to self-regulate, and they often cooperated b/c it helped them operate more efficiently & reduce overproduction |<u>Payne-Aldrich Tariff</u>: Payne bill was originally passed in the house to lower tariffs (very very high), but Senator Aldrich (fighting Bob) restored most of the cuts made by the tariff. Taft ended up passing the tariff, causing a schism in the Republican party: progressives & conservatives. |<u>New Freedom</u>: counter to Roosevelt's "New Nationalism" that revolved around the idea that concentrated economic power threatened individual liberty & that monopolies could be broken up so that the marketplace could be genuinely open. Didn't restore laissez-faire, however.                                                                                                   |
|<u>Hepburn Act</u>: strengthened the [[The Gilded Age#^dbdd35\|Interstate Commerce Commission]] to inspect railroad financials and set "just and reasonable rates". Also required shippers to prove they weren't violating the law                                                                                                                                                           |<u>Mann-Elkins Act</u>: bolstered the regulatory powers of the I.C.C and supported labor reforms such as shorter work hours & mine safety legislation.                                                                                                                                                   |<u>Clayton Anti Trust Act</u>: corrected deficiencies of the [[The Gilded Age#^1a2e5c\|Sherman Anti Trust Act]] by outlawing practices like price discrimination (lowering prices in some regions, but not others) and interlocking directorates (management of 2+ competing companies by the same executives). Also aided labor by exempting unions from its anti-combination provision |
|<u>Meat Inspection/Pure Food and Drug Act</u>: prohibited dangerously altered food and required that labels list all the ingredients of a product. Govt. had to finance inspections; meatpackers could appeal a decision                                                                                                                                                                     | ==16th Amendment==: legalized the federal income tax as a permanent source of federal income                                                                                                                                                                                                      |<u>Federal Trade Commission</u>: investigated companies and could issue cease & desists for unfair legal practices. Accused companies could appeal a decision in court                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|<u>Square Deal/Anthracite Coal Strike</u>: mine owners refuse to arbitrate strikers' demands of 8hr work day and higher pay, so Roosevelt threatened military action (for the first time against owners), forcing the owners to give in; didn't require recognition of union → cooperation                                                                                                   | ==17th Amendment==: provided for the direct election of senators                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | ==Federal Reserve Act==: established the nation's first national banking system since 1836. Created 12 district banks that lent $ to member banks @ low interest rates. By adjusting this rate, inflation could be controlled                                                                                                                                                     |
|<u>Conservationism</u>: Roosevelt first protected natl. wonders like the Olympic Peninsula & Grand Canyon, then expanded conservation w/ the creation of 5 natl. parks + 53 bird conservatories                                                                                                                                                                                              |<u>Taft broke 2x as many trusts in half the time as TR</u> but lacked the ability to rouse the public w/ spirited rhetoric. Also believed in restraint of the law (govt. steps back after enforcing the law)                                                                                             |<u>Underwood Tariff</u>: encouraged importation of cheaper foreign materials/manufactured goods by reducing/eliminating certain tariff rates. To replace $ lost from reductions, the act levied the federal income tax (16th amendment)                                                                                                                                                  |
|<u>Gifford Pinchot</u>: first chief of the US Forest Service who charged fees for grazing @ natl. parks, supervised timber bidding, tripled nation's forest reserves                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | ==Federal Farm Loan Act==: created 12 federally supported banks which lent $ out @ a moderate interest rate to farmers belonging to credit institutions                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

#### Government and legislative reform
- **Weakening the political machines**
	- City managers (hired as experts rather than elected positions), who work as urban planners, and commissioners  
	- ==17th Amendment:== allowed for the direct election of
- **Prohibition**
	- ==Women's Christian Temperance Union== (WCTU): religious organization whose primary purpose was to combat the influence of alcohol on families and society → large supporters of the
	- ==Dry  communities==: regions where alcohol is banned
- Prostitution - ==White Slavery:== anti-prostitution movement sparked by rumors that women were sold into sex trade through prostitution
	- ==White Slave Traffic Act (Mann Act)== (1910): criminalized the transportation "of any woman or girl for the purpose of prostitution or debauchery, or for any other immoral purpose"
- [[The Gilded Age#^915cd1|Brandeis Brief]]
#### Progressive challenges to racial discrimination
- Booker T. Washington believed the way to deal w/ the ongoing assault was to (somewhat) accommodate (==accommodationist==)to the white beliefs to ensure black safety. Argued that African Americans must concentrate on educating themselves in learning useful trades and investing in their own businesses. Hard work would prove the value of blacks to the American economy
	- Atlanta Compromise - [[The Atlanta Exposition Address|"Cast Down Your Bucket"]]
- ==Anti-Bookerites== - "Niagara Movement" and the creation of the NAACP. Economic rights must be coupled with full civil and political rights. Strongly disagreed w/ Washington. Led by DuBois → believed blacks needed full civil and political rights, no accommodation
	- "The way for a people to gain their reasonable rights is to not by voluntarily throwing them away" - DuBois
#### "Social Housekeeping" / Birth Control / Suffrage and Feminism

^22f74a

- Utilitarian argument ([[The Gilded Age#^dd299f|Maternalism]]), argues for rights based on women's special, even superior traits as guardians of the family. Women's morality would humanize society
- Jane Addams on ==Civic Housekeeping==: called on women – especially middle class women w/ leisure and energy, as well as rich philanthropists – to exercise their civic duty to become involved in municipal affairs
- Feminists make a rights based argument → women as **women** – not soldier, not housekeepers –  deserve equal rights because they are American citizens. Emphasis on economic and sexual independence; unpaid female labor is common despite the fact that they make an important economic impact
	- Margret Sanger's *Women and Economics* argue that industrial labor wouldn't be possible w/o women. Also advocates for the distribution of sex and contraception, pushed for the legalization of birth control
- ==National Women's Party==, Harriet Stanton Blatch, Alice Paul: imprisoned for chaining themselves to the gates of the White House, resulting in going on a hunger strike, which creates a large PR problem → leads to Wilson being forced to pass the 19th Amendment
- ==19th Amendment==: gives women the legal right to vote
#### Anti-Imperialists
- Mark Twain, William Jennings Bryan, William Graham Sumner, Jane Addams, Andrew Carnegie, Samuel Gompers (leader of [[March MCQ WIKI#^fe0c73|AFL]])
	- Conquest of people against their will violates US principles of self-determination (DEMOCRACY) - US "puking up its heritage"
	- American character being corrupted by militarism inherent in imperialism
	- Double standard, democracy abroad, [[The Gilded Age#^74a875|Chinese exclusion act]], Jim Crow laws, [[The West#^10886a|Native forced assimilation at home]]
- ==US - Philippine War== (1899 - 1902): US use of concentration camps, attacks on women & children led to large loss of life for Filipinos. Finally gained full independence in 1946
